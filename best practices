Of course. Here are the more detailed technical instructions for implementing the application, breaking down the theory into a concrete, step-by-step technical blueprint.

Technical Implementation Guide for a Modern Canvas Application

This guide provides the technical specifications and sequence of operations for building the application.

I. System Setup and Core Architecture

Project Initialization:

Start with a standard TypeScript-enabled React project (create-react-app my-app --template typescript or similar).

Install the necessary dependencies:

npm install konva react-konva zustand react-konva-utils lucide-react


File Structure:

Organize your src directory to separate concerns. This structure is highly recommended:

src/
├── components/
│   ├── canvas/
│   │   ├── KonvaCanvas.tsx
│   │   └── UnifiedTextElement.tsx
│   └── toolbar/
│       └── KonvaToolbar.tsx
├── stores/
│   └── konvaCanvasStore.ts
└── App.tsx

II. State Management Implementation (zustand)

This is the central nervous system of your application.

Define Interfaces (konvaCanvasStore.ts):

Create a CanvasElement interface. It must include common properties (id, type, x, y) and optional properties for different shapes (width, height, text, radius, points, fill, stroke). The type property should be a string literal union (e.g., 'text' | 'sticky-note' | 'rectangle').

Create a KonvaCanvasState interface. This defines the shape of your entire store.

Structure the State Slices:

elements: Implement this as an object (or map), not an array. The keys should be the element IDs. This allows for O(1) time complexity (instant lookup) when updating a specific element, which is far more performant than searching through an array.

selectedElementId (string | null): Stores the ID of the element selected for transformation (resizing, moving).

editingTextId (string | null): Stores the ID of the element currently in text-editing mode. This must be a separate state from selectedElementId to allow for distinct visual treatments.

selectedTool (string): Stores the ID of the currently active tool from the toolbar (e.g., 'select', 'text').

Implement the Store Actions:

addElement(element): Takes a complete element object. The function should use the spread syntax to create a new elements object, adding the new element using its ID as the key.

updateElement(id, updates): Takes an id and a updates object (a partial element). It finds the element in the elements map, creates a new object for that element by spreading the old properties and the new updates, and returns a new elements map. This enforces the principle of immutability.

setSelectedElement(id): A simple setter. When an element is selected, ensure editingTextId is reset to null.

setEditingTextId(id): A simple setter for the ID of the element being edited.

III. Component Implementation Strategy

KonvaToolbar.tsx:

Fetch the addElement, setSelectedElement, and setSelectedTool actions from the zustand store.

Each tool button's onClick handler will perform the "create-then-select" sequence:

Create the new element object with a unique ID and default properties (centered on the canvas).

Call addElement() with the new object.

Call setSelectedElement() with the new element's ID.

Call setSelectedTool('select').

KonvaCanvas.tsx:

Subscribe to elements, selectedElementId, and editingTextId from the store.

Use Object.values(elements).map(...) to iterate and render the appropriate element components.

Implement the Transformer:

Include a <Transformer> component within the Konva.Layer. Assign a ref to it (e.g., transformerRef).

Use a useEffect hook that has selectedElementId and editingTextId in its dependency array.

Inside the effect: If selectedElementId exists and is not the same as editingTextId, find the corresponding Konva node on the stage (stageRef.current.findOne('#' + selectedElementId)). If found, attach it to the transformer: transformerRef.current.nodes([selectedNode]).

If no element is selected or an element is being edited, detach all nodes: transformerRef.current.nodes([]).

UnifiedTextElement.tsx (or other element components):

Props: This component must receive its full element data object, an isSelected boolean, an isEditing boolean, and the onUpdate, onSelect, and onStartEditing action functions.

Conditional Rendering: The core logic of the component is an if (isEditing) block.

If false: Render the standard react-konva components (<Group>, <Rect>, <Text>). The group should have an onDblClick handler that calls onStartEditing(element.id).

If true: Render the <Html> component from react-konva-utils. Inside it, render a styled <textarea>. The textarea's onBlur event must call onUpdate to save the text and onStartEditing(null) to exit edit mode.

IV. User Interaction & UX Implementation (The "How-To" Recipes)

Recipe: Implement Element Resizing:

Pass an onTransformEnd prop to each rendered Konva element group.

The onTransformEnd event handler must execute the following sequence:

Get the transformed node from the event object: const node = e.target;.

Read and store the scale values: const scaleX = node.scaleX();.

Crucially, reset the node's scale to 1: node.scaleX(1); node.scaleY(1);.

Calculate the final dimensions: const newWidth = node.width() * scaleX;.

Call the updateElement action from the store with the node's new x, y, width, and height.

Recipe: Implement Integrated Text Formatting:

Text formatting is implemented directly within UnifiedTextElement using Html components from react-konva-utils.

The formatting menu appears above the text editing area when in edit mode.

Internal Positioning Logic:

The formatting menu is positioned using fixed positioning relative to the textarea.

Menu position is calculated based on the textarea's screen coordinates.

The menu automatically adjusts its position to stay within viewport bounds.

Formatting options include: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, font size, and color selection.

All formatting changes are applied in real-time with visual feedback.

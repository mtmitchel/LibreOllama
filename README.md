## Tech Stack

LibreOllama is built on a modern, robust, and privacy-focused technology stack with a **consolidated, enterprise-grade architecture**.

* **Framework**: [**Tauri**](https://tauri.app/) - A framework for building lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies.
* **Frontend**: [**React 19**](https://reactjs.org/) & [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For a type-safe, component-based user interface with full React 19 compatibility and concurrent features.
* **Canvas**: [**Konva.js**](https://konvajs.org/) & [**React-Konva**](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva) - High-performance 2D canvas library for professional whiteboard functionality, optimized for React 19's strict rendering requirements.
* **Backend & Core Logic**: [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Powers the secure, high-performance backend, managing everything from database connections to system-level commands.
* **Styling**: [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework with **consolidated design system** in single `globals.css` file, eliminating style fragmentation and import conflicts.
* **State Management**: [**Zustand**](https://zustand.surge.sh/) & React Context API - For simple, predictable state management with React 19 compatible selector patterns, immutable updates, **store-first architecture**, and **memory-optimized viewport culling** with **quadtree spatial indexing** for massive performance gains.
* **Database**: [**SQLCipher**](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) (via `rusqlite`) - An encrypted SQLite database to keep all your data secure at rest.
* **Architecture**: **Feature-based organization** with co-located components, tests, and utilities for optimal maintainability and developer experience.

## Getting Started: Development Setup

Ready to contribute? Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Rust & Cargo**: Required for the Tauri backend. [Install via rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  **Node.js & npm**: Required for the React frontend. We recommend using `nvm` to manage Node versions.
3.  **Tauri CLI**: Install the command-line interface for Tauri development.
    ```bash
    cargo install tauri-cli
    ```
4.  **Ollama**: You'll need a local instance of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running to use the AI features.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git](https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git)
    cd libreollama
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts both the Rust backend and the React frontend in a single, hot-reloading development environment.
    ```bash
    npm run tauri:dev
    ```

    > **Note for Windows users**: The `tauri:dev` script in `package.json` is pre-configured to find your Cargo installation. If you encounter issues, ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your system's `PATH`.

Your LibreOllama desktop application will launch, and any changes you make to the Rust or React code will trigger a rebuild and refresh.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized with a clean, feature-based architecture following modern best practices after comprehensive refactoring (June 2025).

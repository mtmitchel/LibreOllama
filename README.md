## Getting Started: Development Setup

Ready to contribute? Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Rust & Cargo**: Required for the Tauri backend. [Install via rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  **Node.js & npm**: Required for the React frontend. We recommend using `nvm` to manage Node versions.
3.  **Tauri CLI**: Install the command-line interface for Tauri development.
    ```bash
    cargo install tauri-cli
    ```
4.  **Ollama**: You'll need a local instance of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running to use the AI features.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git](https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git)
    cd libreollama
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts both the Rust backend and the React frontend in a single, hot-reloading development environment.
    ```bash
    npm run tauri:dev
    ```

    > **Note for Windows users**: The `tauri:dev` script in `package.json` is pre-configured to find your Cargo installation. If you encounter issues, ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your system's `PATH`.

Your LibreOllama desktop application will launch, and any changes you make to the Rust or React code will trigger a rebuild and refresh.

## React 19 Compatibility

**✅ Full React 19 Support**: LibreOllama is built with complete React 19 compatibility, featuring:

- **🎯 Zero Infinite Render Loops**: Eliminated all object-returning Zustand selectors that caused React 19's `getSnapshot should be cached` errors
- **🔧 Strict Hook Compliance**: All hooks follow React 19's Rules of Hooks with no invalid hook calls in event handlers
- **⚡ Optimal Performance**: Individual primitive selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders and state thrashing
- **🛡️ Production Ready**: Stable canvas operations with React 19's concurrent features and strict mode

**Technical Implementation**:
- Zustand selectors use individual primitive patterns instead of object destructuring
- All store hooks declared at component top level with proper `useCallback` optimization
- Event handlers reference pre-declared hooks rather than calling hooks directly
- Architecture validated against React 19's strict rendering requirements

For detailed technical information, see [Phase 5G: React 19 Compatibility Resolution](./docs/CANVAS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md#phase-5g-react-19-compatibility-resolution) in the Canvas Development Roadmap.

- **Calendar & Tasks**: Planned integration with Google Calendar and Tasks APIs for seamless scheduling and to-do management.
- **LLM API Support**: Upcoming support for popular LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) to extend AI capabilities beyond local models.

## Testing Infrastructure & Quality Assurance

LibreOllama maintains enterprise-grade quality through comprehensive testing infrastructure that has undergone significant architectural improvements and stabilization, with **Phase 6A comprehensive functionality validation** ensuring all critical store operations are production-ready.

### **🚀 Core Testing Principles (MUST FOLLOW)**

All testing in LibreOllama follows these fundamental principles for optimal performance and reliability:

#### **1. Use Store-First Testing**
Test business logic directly through store operations rather than UI rendering:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Direct store testing
const store = createCanvasStore();
act(() => {
  store.getState().addElement(mockElement);
  store.getState().updateElement(elementId, { title: 'Updated' });
});
expect(store.getState().elements.size).toBe(1);

// ❌ WRONG: UI rendering testing
render(<CanvasComponent />);
await waitFor(() => expect(screen.getByTestId('element')).toBeInTheDocument());
```

#### **2. Avoid UI Rendering Tests**
Focus on direct store API testing for performance:
- **Performance Gain**: Sub-10ms execution vs. 30-second UI rendering timeouts
- **Reliability**: 100% consistent execution without React dependencies
- **Real Validation**: Tests actual store logic, not mock stubs

#### **3. Use Real Store Instances**
Avoid mocks where possible:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Real store instance
const store = createCanvasStore();
store.getState().createSection(x, y, width, height, 'Test');

// ❌ WRONG: Mock-heavy approach
const mockStore = { createSection: vi.fn() };
```

#### **4. Test Specific Functionality**
Create targeted tests for specific fixes:
- Test coordinate normalization for section tool
- Test stroke rendering for pen tool
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Avoid broad integration tests that are slow and unreliable

### **Test Environment Architecture**

**Testing Stack**:
- **Test Runner**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Fast, Vite-native test runner with excellent TypeScript support
- **Testing Libraries**: React Testing Library for component testing, with custom utilities for canvas interactions
- **Mocking**: Comprehensive mocking strategies for Konva.js, React-Konva, and Zustand stores
- **Performance Testing**: Direct store API testing patterns for millisecond-level performance validation
- **Functionality Validation**: 14 comprehensive user interaction tests covering real-world production workflows

### **Recent Testing Breakthroughs (June 2025)**

**Phase 6A Comprehensive Functionality Testing**:
- **✅ Gap Analysis Completed**: Comprehensive analysis revealed and filled critical functionality gaps
- **✅ Connector Management Validated**: Full CRUD operations for dynamic connectors with attachment/detachment
- **✅ Advanced Selection Testing**: Geometric, hierarchical, and property-based selection operations
- **✅ Coordinate Conversion Verified**: Section coordinate transformation with cross-store integration
- **✅ Real-World Scenarios**: Cross-session persistence, multi-element operations, bulk updates
- **✅ Production Workflows**: Element visibility/lock management, connector relationship queries

### **Architectural Testing Overhaul (June 23, 2025)**

The testing infrastructure underwent a **complete architectural restructuring** to eliminate brittle global mocks in favor of robust, maintainable testing patterns:

#### **🚀 Major Achievements**
- **Architectural Revolution**: Replaced global mock infrastructure with vanilla Zustand testing using real store instances
- **50/50 Store Tests Passing**: All store logic tests now use real implementations instead of hollow mock stubs
- **10/10 Integration Tests Passing**: Comprehensive workflow testing with actual store interactions
- **Professional Testing Patterns**: Established industry-standard testing practices that validate real application behavior

#### **🔧 Technical Breakthroughs**
1. **Global Mock Elimination**: Removed all brittle global store mocks that provided non-functional stub implementations
2. **Vanilla Zustand Testing**: Implemented `createStore` from `zustand/vanilla` with proper Immer middleware integration
3. **React-Konva Mock Enhancement**: Comprehensive component mocking with proper prop forwarding and data-testid support
4. **Real Store Validation**: Tests now validate actual store logic, providing genuine confidence in application behavior

#### **🎯 New Testing Standards**
```typescript
// Vanilla Zustand Testing Pattern: Real store instances
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla';
import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer';

const createTestStore = () => createStore<SelectionState>()(immer(createSelectionStore));

describe('Store Logic', () => {
  let store = createTestStore();
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    store = createTestStore(); // Fresh real store per test
  });
  
  test('validates actual store behavior', () => {
    store.getState().selectElement(ElementId('elem1'));
    expect(store.getState().selectedElementIds).toEqual(new Set([ElementId('elem1')]));
    // Tests actual implementation, not mock stubs
  });
});
```

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Store Test Success Rate**: 50/50 tests passing (100%)
- **Integration Test Success Rate**: 10/10 tests passing (100%)
- **Test Architecture**: Real store instances + comprehensive component mocking
- **Test Reliability**: Eliminated hanging and brittle mock failures
- **Maintainability**: Professional testing patterns that scale with application growth

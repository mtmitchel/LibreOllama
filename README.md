## Getting Started: Development Setup

Ready to contribute? Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Rust & Cargo**: Required for the Tauri backend. [Install via rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  **Node.js & npm**: Required for the React frontend. We recommend using `nvm` to manage Node versions.
3.  **Tauri CLI**: Install the command-line interface for Tauri development.
    ```bash
    cargo install tauri-cli
    ```
4.  **Ollama**: You'll need a local instance of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running to use the AI features.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git](https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git)
    cd libreollama
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts both the Rust backend and the React frontend in a single, hot-reloading development environment.
    ```bash
    npm run tauri:dev
    ```

    > **Note for Windows users**: The `tauri:dev` script in `package.json` is pre-configured to find your Cargo installation. If you encounter issues, ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your system's `PATH`.

Your LibreOllama desktop application will launch, and any changes you make to the Rust or React code will trigger a rebuild and refresh.

## Project Structure

## React 19 Compatibility

**‚úÖ Full React 19 Support**: LibreOllama is built with complete React 19 compatibility, featuring:

- **üéØ Zero Infinite Render Loops**: Eliminated all object-returning Zustand selectors that caused React 19's `getSnapshot should be cached` errors
- **üîß Strict Hook Compliance**: All hooks follow React 19's Rules of Hooks with no invalid hook calls in event handlers
- **‚ö° Optimal Performance**: Individual primitive selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders and state thrashing
- **üõ°Ô∏è Production Ready**: Stable canvas operations with React 19's concurrent features and strict mode

**Technical Implementation**:
- Zustand selectors use individual primitive patterns instead of object destructuring
- All store hooks declared at component top level with proper `useCallback` optimization
- Event handlers reference pre-declared hooks rather than calling hooks directly
- Architecture validated against React 19's strict rendering requirements

For detailed technical information, see [Phase 5G: React 19 Compatibility Resolution](./docs/CANVAS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md#phase-5g-react-19-compatibility-resolution) in the Canvas Development Roadmap.

// Vanilla Zustand Testing Pattern: Real store instances
import { createStore } from 'zustand/vanilla';
import { immer } from 'zustand/middleware/immer';

const createTestStore = () => createStore<SelectionState>()(immer(createSelectionStore));

describe('Store Logic', () => {
  let store = createTestStore();
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    store = createTestStore(); // Fresh real store per test
  });
  
  test('validates actual store behavior', () => {
    store.getState().selectElement(ElementId('elem1'));
    expect(store.getState().selectedElementIds).toEqual(new Set([ElementId('elem1')]));
    // Tests actual implementation, not mock stubs
  });
});
```

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Store Test Success Rate**: 50/50 tests passing (100%)
- **Integration Test Success Rate**: 10/10 tests passing (100%)
- **Test Architecture**: Real store instances + comprehensive component mocking
- **Test Reliability**: Eliminated hanging and brittle mock failures
- **Maintainability**: Professional testing patterns that scale with application growth

### **Documentation & Best Practices**
Comprehensive documentation of the debugging journey and architectural decisions can be found in:
- [`docs/CANVAS_TESTING_PLAN.md`](docs/CANVAS_TESTING_PLAN.md) - Detailed testing plan with debugging insights
- [`docs/CANVAS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`](docs/CANVAS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) - Development phases including testing infrastructure evolution

The testing infrastructure now provides a solid foundation for confident deployment with fast feedback loops and reliable quality assurance.

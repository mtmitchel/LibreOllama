**LibreOllama** is more than just a collection of tools; it's an integrated, desktop application designed to be your single workspace for thinking, creating, and organizing. By harnessing the power of local AI through Ollama and a user experience crafted for neurodivergent minds, LibreOllama provides a calm, focused, and powerful environment to get work done without compromising your data.

Built with **Tauri**, **React**, and **Rust**, it's a cross-platform application that runs securely on your machine.

## Core Philosophy

* **AI-Powered Productivity**: Leveraging AI to enhance your workflow and creativity.
* **Extensible Integrations**: Future integration with Google Calendar & Tasks APIs and upcoming support for various LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
* **All-in-One Workspace**: Chat, Projects, Tasks, Notes, and a professional-grade Canvas in a single, cohesive interface.

## Features

LibreOllama provides a suite of deeply integrated tools designed to work together seamlessly.

| Feature          | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dashboard** | Your "command center." Get a clear overview of your day with widgets for active projects, today's focus, and agent statuses.                                            |
| **AI Chat** | A powerful, clean interface for interacting with your local LLMs. Supports conversation history, model switching, and more.                                               |
| **Projects** | A dedicated hub for each of your projects. Track progress, manage assets, and see a unified view of all related notes, tasks, and canvases.                              |
| **Notes** | A block-based editor for capturing ideas, structuring thoughts, and creating rich documents. Think Notion, but private and local.                                       |
| **Canvas** | A professional-grade infinite whiteboard powered by **Konva.js**. Create and connect ideas with **15+ element types** including text, shapes, sticky notes, enhanced tables, and smart connectors. Features **rich text editing** with floating toolbars, **8-handle table resizing**, **FigJam-style sections** for organization, pan/zoom navigation, and **50-state undo/redo**.

Built for visual thinking, diagramming, mind-mapping, and collaborative brainstorming with professional-grade interactions and performance optimization. |
| **Tasks** | A visual Kanban board to manage your to-do lists. Drag and drop tasks between "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."                                                        |
| **Calendar** | Plan your time and visualize your schedule. Designed to integrate with your tasks and project timelines.                                                                |
| **Agents** | The intelligence layer. Configure, manage, and monitor your local AI agents and models.                                                                                 |
| **Settings** | Granular control over the application, including theme, integrations, and model management.                                                                             |
| **Command Palette** | The power-user's best friend. Press `Ctrl+K` (`Cmd+K` on Mac) to instantly navigate anywhere, create new items, or perform actions.                                     |

## Tech Stack

LibreOllama is built on a modern, robust, and privacy-focused technology stack.

* **Framework**: [**Tauri**](https://tauri.app/) - A framework for building lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies.
* **Frontend**: [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) & [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For a type-safe, component-based user interface.
* **Canvas**: [**Konva.js**](https://konvajs.org/) & [**React-Konva**](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva) - High-performance 2D canvas library for professional whiteboard functionality.
* **Backend & Core Logic**: [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Powers the secure, high-performance backend, managing everything from database connections to system-level commands.
* **Styling**: [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid, consistent styling, configured to use our internal design token system.
* **State Management**: [**Zustand**](https://zustand.surge.sh/) & React Context API - For simple, predictable state management with immer for immutable updates.
* **Database**: [**SQLCipher**](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) (via `rusqlite`) - An encrypted SQLite database to keep all your data secure at rest.

## Getting Started: Development Setup

Ready to contribute? Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Rust & Cargo**: Required for the Tauri backend. [Install via rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  **Node.js & npm**: Required for the React frontend. We recommend using `nvm` to manage Node versions.
3.  **Tauri CLI**: Install the command-line interface for Tauri development.
    ```bash
    cargo install tauri-cli
    ```
4.  **Ollama**: You'll need a local instance of [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running to use the AI features.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git](https://github.com/mtmitchel/libreollama.git)
    cd libreollama
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts both the Rust backend and the React frontend in a single, hot-reloading development environment.
    ```bash
    npm run tauri:dev
    ```

    > **Note for Windows users**: The `tauri:dev` script in `package.json` is pre-configured to find your Cargo installation. If you encounter issues, ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your system's `PATH`.

Your LibreOllama desktop application will launch, and any changes you make to the Rust or React code will trigger a rebuild and refresh.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to maintain a clear separation between the frontend and backend code.

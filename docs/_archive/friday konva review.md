## Canvas Refactoring & Audit Report: LibreOllama (Deep Dive)

### **Overview**

This deep-dive audit provides a granular analysis of the LibreOllama canvas feature by inspecting the provided source code. The initial architectural assessment was positive, and this review confirms that the codebase contains a sophisticated, feature-rich implementation.

However, this analysis also reveals critical deviations from the *Ultimate Guide* and *Developer Checklist*, particularly in state management, event handling, and type safety. These deviations introduce significant risks to performance, maintainability, and reliability.

The following plan provides specific, actionable steps to address these issues and fully align the codebase with our target architecture.

-----

### **Phase 1: Review & Audit (Code-Level Analysis)**

#### **1.1. Architecture and Data Flow**

  * **State Management (Zustand)**

      * **Finding (Critical):** The primary store in `canvasStore.enhanced.ts` combines multiple slices into a single `useCanvasStore` hook. While sliced, the implementation pattern leads to significant issues. The store holds a mix of state and functions, but many components bypass the store's actions, modifying state directly or containing business logic that should be in the store.
      * **Finding (Critical):** There is significant state duplication. The `selectionStore` (`selectionStore.ts`) holds copies of element objects in its `elements` array, violating the single-source-of-truth principle. The authoritative element data is in `canvasElementsStore.ts`. This will lead to desynchronization bugs.
      * **Strength:** The use of Immer is correctly implemented, which helps prevent direct state mutation errors.

  * **Component Hierarchy & Logic**

      * **Finding (Critical):** Event handling is not consistently delegated. While a `CanvasEventHandler.tsx` exists, many individual shape components contain their own complex event logic. For instance, `EnhancedTableElement.tsx` has its own `onDragMove`, `onDragEnd`, and `onTransform` handlers, directly calling store actions. This scatters business logic across the UI layer, making it hard to debug and maintain. [cite\_start]This contradicts the principle of keeping event handlers thin[cite: 2430].
      * **Finding:** The main application entry point, `KonvaApp.tsx`, is overly complex. It contains numerous state subscriptions and useEffects that manage selections, transformations, and tool switching. This logic should be moved into dedicated hooks or the state store itself to simplify the component.
      * **Strength:** The `CanvasLayerManager.tsx` correctly separates concerns into distinct Konva Layers (`MainLayer`, `UILayer`, `ConnectorLayer`, etc.). [cite\_start]This aligns perfectly with the guide's recommendation for layer-based rendering[cite: 2417, 2525].

#### **1.2. Performance & Optimization**

  * **Viewport Culling & Spatial Indexing**

      * **Strength:** The project has a `Quadtree.ts` implementation and a `useViewportCulling.ts` hook. The hook correctly identifies visible elements based on the viewport. [cite\_start]This is a major performance win and aligns with best practices[cite: 2416, 2566].
      * **Finding:** The `ElementRenderer.tsx` does not appear to use the `useViewportCulling` hook. It iterates over the entire `canvasElements` map from the store. This completely negates the benefit of the quadtree, forcing React to process every element on every render, leading to severe performance degradation on large canvases.

  * **Shape Caching**

      * **Strength:** The presence of `CachedShape.tsx` and `useShapeCaching.ts` demonstrates that caching is being considered.
      * **Finding:** The caching logic in `useShapeCaching.ts` is tied to zoom levels but isn't explicitly connected to changes in the shape's own properties. Caching should be invalidated and reapplied when a shape's visual attributes (color, size, stroke) change, not just on viewport changes. [cite\_start]The guide mentions caching complex shapes[cite: 2573], which this implementation attempts but could refine.

  * **Node Pooling**

      * **Finding:** There is no evidence of a node pooling system in the codebase. [cite\_start]The checklist explicitly recommends this to reduce garbage collection overhead[cite: 2418]. Elements are created and destroyed directly.

#### **1.3. Type Safety**

  * **Finding (Critical):** Type safety is weak and inconsistent.
      * The project makes extensive use of the `any` type, particularly in store actions and component props. For example, `canvasHistoryStore.ts` uses `any` for its history stack.
      * The core element types defined in `types.ts` are not consistently used as discriminated unions. The `CanvasElement` type is a simple union, which leads to frequent type casting and optional chaining in components, undermining type safety. [cite\_start]The checklist mandates discriminated unions for this purpose[cite: 2425].
      * `KonvaApp.tsx` and other components often default to `any` for event objects and state variables, such as `const [selectionRect, setSelectionRect] = useState(null);` which should be properly typed.

#### **1.4. Frontend-Backend Interface (Tauri)**

  * **Strength:** The `useTauriCanvas.ts` hook centralizes interactions with the backend, which is good practice.
  * **Finding:** The payloads for `invoke` calls are not strongly typed using shared definitions. [cite\_start]For example, the `saveCanvas` function constructs a payload inline without importing a shared type[cite: 2968]. This can lead to silent failures if the Rust and TypeScript types drift apart. [cite\_start]This violates the principle of using typed schemas for API contracts[cite: 2425].

### **Phase 2: Blueprint & Planning**

This refined blueprint addresses the specific code-level issues identified above.

#### **2.1. Optimized Store Design**

1.  **Eliminate State Duplication:**

      * **Task:** Refactor `selectionStore.ts`. The `elements: CanvasElement[]` property will be removed. It will be replaced with `selectedElementIds: Set<string>`.
      * **Task:** Create a new, memoized selector `selectSelectedElements(state)` that retrieves the full element objects from `canvasElementsStore` using the IDs from `selectionStore`. Components will use this selector to get the data they need, ensuring a single source of truth.

2.  **Enforce Store-First Logic:**

      * **Task:** Create a new store slice, `toolLogicStore.ts`. This slice will contain actions that encapsulate the logic for what happens when a tool is used (e.g., `handlePenMove`, `handleSectionDraw`).
      * **Task:** The `KonvaApp.tsx` `useEffect` hooks that manage tool state will be removed. Their logic will be moved into actions within this new slice.

#### **2.2. Component Refactoring Strategy**

1.  **Activate Viewport Culling:**

      * **Task:** Modify `ElementRenderer.tsx`. It will now use the `useViewportCulling()` hook to get a list of visible element IDs. The component will then iterate over this reduced list of IDs to render shapes, instead of the entire `canvasElements` map.

2.  **Centralize Event Handling:**

      * **Task:** Refactor all shape components (e.g., `EnhancedTableElement.tsx`). Remove all `onDragMove`, `onDragEnd`, `onTransform`, and other interactive event handlers. These components should become "dumb" and only receive props for rendering.
      * **Task:** All interaction logic will be consolidated into `CanvasEventHandler.tsx`. This component will listen for events on the Konva `Stage` and dispatch high-level actions to the store (e.g., `store.dispatch('elementDragged', { elementId, deltaX, deltaY })`).

3.  **Implement Node Pooling:**

      * **Task:** Create a `NodePool.ts` utility class. This class will manage a pool of reusable Konva `Shape` instances.
      * **Task:** When `ElementRenderer.tsx` adds a shape to the stage, it will request a node from the pool. [cite\_start]When a shape is culled (goes off-screen), its Konva node will be returned to the pool instead of being destroyed, as recommended by the checklist[cite: 2418].

-----

### **Phase 3: Refactor & Implement**

#### **3.1. Enforce Strict TypeScript**

1.  **Discriminated Unions:**

      * **Task:** Refactor `features/canvas/types.ts`. The `CanvasElement` type will be converted into a true discriminated union, where each member interface has a unique literal type property (e.g., `type: 'shape' | 'sticky-note'`).
      * **Example:**
        ```typescript
        interface ShapeElement {
          type: 'shape';
          id: string;
          // ... other shape properties
        }
        interface StickyNoteElement {
          type: 'sticky-note';
          id: string;
          // ... other note properties
        }
        export type CanvasElement = ShapeElement | StickyNoteElement;
        ```

2.  **Eliminate `any`:**

      * **Task:** Conduct a project-wide search for the `any` type and replace every instance with a specific type. This includes event handlers, store states, and component props. For the history store, we will use `Partial<CanvasState>` instead of `any`.

3.  **Shared IPC Types:**

      * **Task:** Create a file `src/types/ipc-contracts.ts`. This file will define the payload and response types for every Tauri command. These types will be imported and used in both `useTauriCanvas.ts` and the corresponding Rust command handlers.

#### **3.2. Document and Test**

1.  **Documentation:** Add TSDoc comments to all refactored components, hooks, and store actions, explaining the new, centralized data flow.
2.  **Testing:**
      * Write new unit tests for all store actions in `toolLogicStore.ts`.
      * [cite\_start]Write integration tests that simulate a user workflow (e.g., select tool -\> draw shape -\> move shape) by dispatching actions to the store and asserting the final state, as described in the guide's testing chapter[cite: 2832].
      * Enhance the performance test suite to specifically measure the impact of viewport culling on render times.

### **Phase 4: Deliver & Validate**

#### **4.1. Deliverables**

The deliverable is a pull request containing the fully refactored and documented codebase, which directly addresses the critical issues found during this deep-dive audit.

#### **4.2. Validation**

1.  **Correctness:** Manually verify that all features work as expected, paying special attention to selection, transformation, and tool switching, which were the areas with the most scattered logic.
2.  **Performance:**
      * **Metric:** Frame Rate (FPS) during rapid pan/zoom on a canvas with 5,000+ elements.
      * **Expected Outcome:** The FPS should remain consistently above 45, a significant improvement from the current state where it would likely drop below 10 due to the lack of effective culling.
      * **Metric:** Memory usage after adding and removing 1,000 elements.
      * [cite\_start]**Expected Outcome:** With node pooling, memory usage should return to a baseline close to the initial state, demonstrating a reduction in memory leaks and GC pressure[cite: 2435].
3.  **Reliability:** The elimination of state duplication and `any` types should result in a measurable decrease in potential runtime errors. The new, robust test suite will ensure this reliability is maintained.

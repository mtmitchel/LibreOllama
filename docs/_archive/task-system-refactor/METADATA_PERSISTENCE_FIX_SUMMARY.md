# Metadata Persistence Fix Summary

## Root Cause
The Zustand store was persisting stale task data to localStorage, which was overwriting fresh data fetched from the backend on page refresh.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Store Persistence (src/stores/googleTasksStore.ts)
- Modified `partialize` to only persist authentication state
- Removed `tasks`, `taskLists`, and `lastSyncAt` from persistence
- Added cleanup logic to remove old persisted task data

### 2. Fixed Metadata Preservation in Sync (src/services/kanbanGoogleTasksSync.ts)
- Updated `googleToKanbanTask` to preserve metadata from Google Tasks
- Ensures priority, labels, and due dates are maintained during sync
- Properly types priority field to match TypeScript constraints

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed console logging to track metadata flow
- Logs show when tasks are fetched, stored, and synced

## How It Works Now

1. **Backend**: The Rust backend properly merges Google Tasks data with local SQLite metadata
2. **Frontend Store**: Only persists authentication state, fetches fresh task data on each load
3. **Sync Service**: Preserves metadata when converting between Google Tasks and Kanban formats
4. **Display**: Priority, labels, and due dates now persist across page refreshes

## Testing
1. Create a task with priority, labels, and due date
2. Refresh the page
3. All metadata should be preserved and displayed correctly

## Technical Details
- Google Tasks API stores: title, notes, due date, status
- Local SQLite stores: priority, labels (as metadata)
- The hybrid system merges both data sources seamlessly

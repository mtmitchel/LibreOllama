# Task Metadata Persistence Fix Summary

## The Issue
Task metadata (priority, labels, due dates) was not persisting after page refresh, even though the backend was correctly saving and loading the data.

## Root Cause
TWO issues were preventing metadata persistence:

1. **Update requests missing metadata**: The sync process was updating tasks WITHOUT metadata, which was wiping it out in the backend
2. **Timestamp comparison blocking sync**: The sync only updated Kanban tasks if Google tasks were "newer", but they often had the same timestamp, so metadata was never synced from Google to Kanban on refresh

## The Fix

### 1. Updated GoogleTasksStore.updateTask()
Added metadata to the update payload:
```typescript
metadata: updates.metadata ? {
  priority: updates.metadata.priority,
  labels: updates.metadata.labels
} : undefined
```

### 2. Updated KanbanGoogleTasksSync sync process
Modified the sync update to include metadata:
```typescript
await googleStore.updateTask(
  mapping.googleTaskListId,
  existingGoogleTask.id,
  {
    ...this.kanbanToGoogleTask(kanbanTask),
    metadata: kanbanTask.metadata ? {
      priority: kanbanTask.metadata.priority,
      labels: kanbanTask.metadata.labels
    } : undefined
  }
);
```

### 3. Added Logging
Added console logging to track metadata during sync updates for debugging.

## Testing
1. Create a task with metadata (priority, labels, due date)
2. Refresh the page
3. Metadata should now persist correctly
4. Check console logs for confirmation

## What Was Already Working
- Backend SQLite storage ✅
- Backend loading and merging ✅
- Initial task creation with metadata ✅
- GoogleTasksStore receiving metadata ✅
- KanbanStore displaying metadata ✅

## What Was Fixed
- Sync process now preserves metadata during updates ✅
- No more "No metadata provided" warnings in backend logs ✅

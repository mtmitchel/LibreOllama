# Task System Production Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Metadata Overwrites (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: When updating priority, labels were deleted and vice versa
**Root Cause**: UI components were passing entire metadata objects instead of just changed fields
**Solution**: 
- Deep merge already worked correctly in `taskMetadataStore.ts`
- Fixed UI components to only pass changed fields:
  - `handleUpdatePriority`: Now only passes `{ priority }`
  - Task modal: Now only passes specific fields instead of entire metadata object

### 2. Deleted Tasks Reappearing (FIXED ✅)
**Problem**: Tasks deleted locally would be recreated on next sync
**Solution**: 
- Added `deleted?: boolean` flag to TaskMetadata interface
- Updated `handleDeleteTask` in TasksAsanaClean.tsx to mark tasks as deleted before removal
- Updated sync service to skip deleted tasks during sync

### 3. Delete Order (ALREADY CORRECT ✅)
- Confirmed that tasks are deleted from Google first, then locally
- This prevents the sync service from thinking a local task needs to be created in Google

### 4. Console Spam (ALREADY DISABLED ✅)
- Automatic sync updates were already commented out in the sync service
- Only manual sync operations trigger updates now

## Test Results
All tests passing:
- ✅ Metadata store tests (4/4 passed)
- ✅ Deleted flag tests (3/3 passed)  
- ✅ Integration tests (2/2 passed)

## Code Changes

### src/stores/taskMetadataStore.ts
- Added `deleted?: boolean` to TaskMetadata interface
- Fixed deep merge to preserve all fields when updating

### src/app/pages/TasksAsanaClean.tsx
- Added metadata marking as deleted before task removal:
```typescript
const { setTaskMetadata } = useTaskMetadataStore.getState();
setTaskMetadata(googleTaskId || taskId, { deleted: true });
```

### src/services/kanbanGoogleTasksSync.ts
- Added checks to skip deleted tasks:
```typescript
const metadataFromStore = useTaskMetadataStore.getState().getTaskMetadata(googleTask.id);
if (metadataFromStore?.deleted) {
  logger.debug(`[SYNC] Skipping deleted task: ${googleTask.title}`);
  continue;
}
```

## Production Deployment
The fixes are ready for production. After deployment:
1. Deleted tasks will no longer reappear after sync
2. Metadata updates will preserve all fields (no more data loss)
3. Console remains clean (no spam from automatic updates)

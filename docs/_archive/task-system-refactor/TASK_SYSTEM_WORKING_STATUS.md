# Task System - Current Working Status

## âœ… What's Working Now

### Core CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new tasks via "Add task" button
- **Read**: Tasks display in columns with all data
- **Update**: Edit tasks, set priority, add labels/subtasks
- **Delete**: Remove tasks via context menu

### Data Persistence
- Tasks persist across page refreshes
- Metadata (labels, priority, subtasks) is saved
- Column state is maintained
- All data stored in localStorage

### UI Features
- Drag and drop between columns
- Double-click to edit task titles
- Right-click context menu for actions
- Priority badges display correctly
- Labels show on task cards
- Due dates are saved and displayed

## ðŸ”§ Current Implementation

### Storage Architecture
1. **Kanban Store** (`kanban-store` in localStorage)
   - Columns and tasks
   - Task positions
   - Basic task data

2. **Metadata Store** (`task-metadata-store` in localStorage)
   - Labels
   - Priority
   - Subtasks
   - Recurring settings

### Sync Status
- Google Tasks sync is **DISABLED**
- Running in offline mode with local storage
- No automatic syncing with Google Tasks

## ðŸ“‹ Known Limitations

1. **No Google Tasks Integration**
   - Changes don't sync to Google Tasks
   - Can't pull tasks from Google Tasks
   - "New List" button won't create Google Task lists

2. **ID System**
   - Using local Kanban IDs (format: `task-timestamp-random`)
   - Not compatible with Google Task IDs
   - Will need remapping when sync is re-enabled

3. **Default Columns**
   - Fixed columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "Done"
   - Can't create/delete columns without Google Tasks

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (When Ready)

### Option 1: Continue with Local-Only
- Keep using as an offline task manager
- All features work without Google integration
- Simple and reliable

### Option 2: Re-enable Google Sync
1. Fix ID mapping between systems
2. Handle sync conflicts
3. Preserve metadata during sync
4. Test incremental sync

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Local tasks + selective Google sync
- Manual sync button
- Choose which lists to sync

## ðŸ’¾ Backup Your Data

To backup your current tasks:
```javascript
// Export all data
const backup = {
  kanban: localStorage.getItem('kanban-store'),
  metadata: localStorage.getItem('task-metadata-store'),
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
};
console.log(JSON.stringify(backup));

// Save the output to a file
```

To restore:
```javascript
// Paste your backup data
const backup = { /* your backup */ };
localStorage.setItem('kanban-store', backup.kanban);
localStorage.setItem('task-metadata-store', backup.metadata);
location.reload();
```

## âœ¨ Summary

The task system is now fully functional as a local task manager. You can:
- Create tasks with rich metadata
- Organize with labels and priorities
- Track with subtasks and due dates
- Everything saves automatically

The system is stable and usable in its current state!

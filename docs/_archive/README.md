## Archive Policy

**Files are archived when:**
- They have been consolidated into newer, comprehensive documents
- They represent outdated approaches or implementations
- They are superseded by current active documentation
- They contain historical value but are no longer actively referenced

**Files are deleted when:**
- They are purely temporary artifacts (logs, debug files)
- They are exact duplicates with no historical value
- They are build artifacts or configuration backups
- They contain no unique information

## Current Active Documentation

For current, active documentation, see:
- [Documentation Hub](../README.md) - Main documentation index
- [Production Readiness Plan](../PRODUCTION_READINESS.md) - Current project roadmap
- [Design System](../DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) - Active design system documentation
- [Architecture Guide](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - Current technical architecture
- [Testing Strategy](../TESTING_STRATEGY.md) - Current testing approach

## Accessing Archived Content

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference and understanding of feature evolution
- Onboarding new team members to understand decision context
- Research and analysis of past implementation approaches
- Compliance and audit requirements

**Note:** Archived documentation should not be used for current development decisions. Always refer to active documentation for current practices and patterns.

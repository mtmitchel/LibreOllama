# Security Improvements Summary

## Critical Security Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ OAuth 2.0 PKCE Authentication Flow (HIGH SEVERITY - FIXED)

**Issue**: The application was not using the secure GmailAuthService.ts which implements OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow. Instead, authentication was directly calling Tauri commands without proper security measures.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `SecureAuthHandler.ts` that properly integrates GmailAuthService
- Updated `GoogleAuthModal.tsx` to use the secure authentication handler
- Ensures PKCE flow is used for all OAuth authentications
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Files Modified**:
- Created: `src/features/google/services/SecureAuthHandler.ts`
- Updated: `src/features/google/components/GoogleAuthModal.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Automatic Token Refresh (MEDIUM SEVERITY - FIXED)

**Issue**: No automatic token refresh mechanism was in place, leading to unexpected logouts when tokens expired.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Implemented automatic token refresh in SecureAuthHandler
- Checks tokens every 5 minutes
- Refreshes tokens 10 minutes before expiry
- Emits events when tokens are refreshed
- Added `validateAccessToken` method to GmailAuthService

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/google/services/SecureAuthHandler.ts`
- `src/services/gmail/GmailAuthService.ts`

### 3. ✅ Secure Account Persistence (MEDIUM SEVERITY - FIXED)

**Issue**: Google account information was being stored in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `secureSessionStore.ts` for non-sensitive session management
- Updated `settingsStore.ts` to exclude googleAccounts from localStorage persistence
- Added secure rehydration from backend on app startup
- Only session ID and non-sensitive data persisted to localStorage

**Files Modified**:
- Created: `src/stores/secureSessionStore.ts`
- Updated: `src/stores/settingsStore.ts` (partialize function)
- `mailStore.ts` already had proper partialize configuration

### 4. ✅ XSS Protection in Email Rendering (HIGH SEVERITY - FIXED)

**Issue**: Email content was being sanitized with a basic regex-based approach, which is insufficient for preventing XSS attacks.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive `secureSanitizer.ts` using DOMPurify
- Implements industrial-strength HTML sanitization
- Added email-specific security policies
- Blocks dangerous URL schemes (javascript:, data:, etc.)
- Configurable image and style blocking
- Security warnings for blocked content
- Proper handling of quoted text

**Files Modified**:
- Created: `src/features/mail/utils/secureSanitizer.ts`
- Updated: `src/features/mail/components/EnhancedMessageRenderer.tsx`
- Installed: `dompurify` and `@types/dompurify`

## Additional Security Measures

### Content Security Policy
- All external links open with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Images loaded with `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"`
- Blocked inline styles by default (configurable)

### URL Validation
- Blocks javascript:, data:, vbscript:, file: URLs
- Validates email addresses to prevent header injection

### Token Storage
- Tokens stored in OS keyring via Tauri secure storage
- No sensitive data in browser storage
- Encrypted token storage option available

## Additional Improvements Completed

### 5. ✅ State Management Refactoring (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COMPLETED)

**Issue**: Complex state management logic was scattered across Calendar and Tasks components, making them difficult to test and maintain.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `enhancedCalendarStore.ts` to centralize calendar UI state and business logic
- Created `enhancedTasksStore.ts` to centralize tasks UI state and business logic
- Moved all modal states, form handling, and operations to stores
- Improved separation of concerns between UI and business logic

**Files Created**:
- `src/stores/enhancedCalendarStore.ts`
- `src/stores/enhancedTasksStore.ts`

### 6. ✅ Centralized Error Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COMPLETED)

**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across different stores and services.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive `errorHandler.ts` module
- Standardized error types and error contexts
- Added automatic logging, notifications, and error reporting
- Provided specialized error handlers for each service
- Implemented error queue and subscription system

**Files Created**:
- `src/core/errors/errorHandler.ts`

### 7. ✅ Automated Authentication Testing (LOW PRIORITY - COMPLETED)

**Issue**: Manual authentication persistence testing was prone to human error and not run consistently.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Converted manual test to comprehensive automated test suite
- Added tests for Gmail, Calendar, and Tasks authentication
- Included cross-store integration tests
- Added performance benchmarks
- Implemented proper error recovery tests

**Files Created**:
- `src/tests/integration/auth-persistence.test.ts`
**Files Removed**:
- `src/tests/integration/auth-persistence-test.ts` (manual test)

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never store sensitive data in localStorage** - Use secure storage APIs
2. **Always use DOMPurify for HTML sanitization** - Never use regex-based sanitization
3. **Implement PKCE for all OAuth flows** - Essential for desktop applications
4. **Automatic token refresh** - Prevent unexpected logouts
5. **Validate all user input** - Especially email addresses and URLs
6. **Use Content Security Policy headers** - Additional layer of XSS protection
7. **Regular security audits** - Review dependencies and code for vulnerabilities

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test XSS prevention with malicious email samples
2. Verify token refresh works correctly near expiry
3. Ensure no sensitive data leaks to localStorage
4. Test authentication flow with network interruptions
5. Verify secure storage works across different OS platforms

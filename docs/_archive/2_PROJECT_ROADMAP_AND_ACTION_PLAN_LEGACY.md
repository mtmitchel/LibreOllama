This document provides a high-level strategic overview with concrete technical implementation details for project tracking and stakeholder communication.

## 1. Executive Summary & Current Status ‚ö†Ô∏è **ARCHITECTURE UNDER INTENSIVE DEBUGGING**

**Status Update (June 28, 2025):** Critical architectural issues have been identified that prevent consistent canvas functionality. While the unified store foundation is solid, significant conflicts in event handling and state management require systematic resolution.

### üìã **Issue Summary**

| Problem Category | Technical Issue | Impact Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **üö® Event Conflicts** | Dual event systems causing handler conflicts | **CRITICAL** - Elements snap back, tools non-functional |
| **üö® Position Sync** | Store vs Konva node position mismatches | **CRITICAL** - Movement operations fail |
| **üö® Transform Issues** | Multiple transform handlers interfering | **CRITICAL** - Resize/transform operations broken |
| **üö® ReactKonva Warnings** | Missing drag handlers preventing state sync | **HIGH** - Inconsistent behavior, console warnings |
| **üö® Tool Creation** | Shape tools not responding to canvas clicks | **HIGH** - Core functionality broken |

## 2. üîß **Architecture Migration Progress**

The major architectural refactoring phases are substantially complete with some refinement ongoing:

### üîß **Phase 3B: UI/UX Modernization & Toolbar Redesign (MOSTLY COMPLETE)**

* **Objective**: Implement a modern, FigJam-style UI.
* **Technical Status**:
  1. **‚úÖ Component:** `ModernKonvaToolbar.tsx` implemented with floating design
  2. **‚úÖ Positioning:** CSS positioning with sidebar awareness and centering
  3. **‚úÖ State:** Integrated with unified store for tool selection
  4. **üîß Tool Integration:** Basic tools working, advanced tool workflows in development

### üîß **Phase 4: Store Architecture Cleanup (CORE COMPLETE)**

* **Objective**: Establish a single source of truth and centralize all business logic.
* **Technical Status**:
  1. **‚úÖ Unified Store:** `unifiedCanvasStore.ts` operational, combines all state management
  2. **‚úÖ Store Methods:** Core methods implemented, some edge cases need fixes
  3. **üîß Event Handling:** `UnifiedEventHandler` framework complete, tool-specific handlers in progress
  4. **‚úÖ Rendering Pipeline:** Store ‚Üí LayerManager ‚Üí MainLayer chain functional

## 3. üö® **Critical Issues Identified & Debugging Patterns**

### **üî¥ Immediate Blocking Issues**
- **Element Position Persistence**: All dragged elements snap back to original positions after mouse release
- **Section Movement Failure**: Sections cannot be moved or resized despite visual feedback during operation
- **Shape Tool Non-Response**: Rectangle/Circle/Triangle/Star tools not creating elements on canvas click
- **Transform Handle Disappearance**: Resize handles vanish after element reselection
- **Table Resize Failure**: Tables snap back to original size after resize operations

### **üîß Architectural Patterns Identified**
- **Dual Event System Conflicts**: Both stage-level (UnifiedEventHandler) and element-level (MainLayer) handlers compete
- **Transform Handler Duplication**: TransformerManager and UnifiedEventHandler both handle transform events
- **Position Update Race Conditions**: Store updates and Konva node positions get out of sync
- **ReactKonva Integration Issues**: Missing onDragEnd handlers prevent proper state synchronization
- **Event Handler Cleanup Problems**: Handlers not properly removed causing memory leaks and conflicts

### **üîç Debugging Approaches Attempted**
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track event flow and state changes
- **Handler Consolidation**: Attempted to remove duplicate transform handlers (partial success)
- **Store Update Validation**: Added validation to prevent invalid position updates
- **Event Handler Registration**: Improved event handler cleanup and registration patterns

### **üö® Development Workflow Impact**
- **Regression Introduction**: Fixes for one issue often introduce new problems in other areas
- **Testing Complexity**: Manual testing required for each change due to complex interaction patterns
- **Documentation Gaps**: Current behavior doesn't match documented expectations

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è **Required Immediate Actions: Systematic Debugging**

Before advancing to new features, critical architectural issues must be resolved:

### **Priority 1: Event Handler Architecture Resolution**
- **Investigate Event Conflicts**: Determine optimal architecture for stage vs element-level event handling
- **Consolidate Transform Management**: Choose between TransformerManager vs UnifiedEventHandler for transforms
- **Fix ReactKonva Integration**: Implement proper onDragEnd handlers to prevent state sync issues
- **Resolve Position Update Conflicts**: Establish single source of truth for element positioning

### **Priority 2: Systematic Issue Resolution**
- **Element Movement Pipeline**: Fix the drag ‚Üí store update ‚Üí render pipeline
- **Shape Tool Debugging**: Investigate why click handlers aren't triggering for shape tools
- **Transform Handle Management**: Fix resize handle visibility and functionality
- **Section Operation Fixes**: Resolve section movement and resizing failures

### **Priority 3: Development Process Improvements**
- **Automated Testing**: Implement integration tests to catch regressions early
- **Debug Tooling**: Create canvas debugging utilities for faster issue identification
- **Documentation Updates**: Align documentation with actual implementation status

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization (Planned)

* **Objective**: Ensure smooth performance with 10,000+ elements.
* **Technical Implementation**:
  1. **Spatial Indexing**: Integrate a quadtree library (e.g., `d3-quadtree`). On canvas pan/zoom, query the tree for visible elements and render only those.
  2. **Layer Separation**: Create three distinct `<Layer>` components as described in the guide: `BackgroundLayer`, `MainContentLayer`, `UILayer`.
  3. **Shape Caching**: For complex shapes or groups, use Konva's built-in caching (`shape.cache()`) to render them to a bitmap, improving redraw performance. This should be applied strategically to elements that are not frequently changing.

## 3. Definition of Done (DoD)

All phases and tasks must meet these criteria for completion.

* [ ] All TypeScript checks (`tsc --noEmit`) must pass. **No new `any` types.**
* [ ] All existing Vitest tests must pass. New logic must have corresponding unit tests.
* [ ] Existing canvas features must remain fully functional (no regressions).
* [ ] Performance must be equal to or better than the previous state (validated via profiling).
* [ ] All new public functions, components, and store slices must have clear JSDoc comments.

## 4. Detailed Implementation Tasks

// ... 7 more store imports

// NEW: Single unified store
import { useUnifiedCanvasStore, canvasSelectors } from './unifiedCanvasStore';
```

**Event Handling Transformation**
```typescript
// OLD: Scattered event logic with type casts

};

// NEW: Centralized, type-safe event handling
const eventHandler = useUnifiedCanvasStore(state => state.eventHandler);
// All event logic handled by EventHandlerManager - zero type casts
```

**Component Simplification**
```typescript
// OLD: 15+ props with type casting requirements
export const MainLayer: React.FC<ComplexProps> = ({ 
  elements, selectedElementIds, onElementClick, onElementDragEnd, ...
}) => {
  // 25+ 'as any' type casts throughout component
};

// NEW: Clean, minimal props with type safety
export const MainLayerRefactored: React.FC<SimpleProps> = ({ name, stageRef }) => {
  const elements = useUnifiedCanvasStore(canvasSelectors.elements);
  const eventHandler = useUnifiedCanvasStore(state => state.eventHandler);
  // Zero type casts - all operations properly typed

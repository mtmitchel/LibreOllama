# LibreOllama Canvas – Implementation Checklist

> **🎯 PROJECT STATUS (December 26, 2024): PHASE 2 COMPLETED** ✅
>
> Canvas cleanup systematic approach validated. TypeScript discriminated union fixes complete.
> Phase 3 (Import standardization) ready to begin.

## 🏗️ Foundation Layers

* [✅] **React-Konva Setup**: Basic implementation in place
* [✅] **Zustand Stores**: Core stores implemented with slice pattern
* [✅] **TypeScript System**: 
    * **COMPLETED Phase 2**: Zero compilation errors (33 → 0)
    * Enhanced discriminated union patterns
    * Proper type guards implemented (isTextElement, isRichTextElement, etc.)
    * StickyNoteElement enhanced with rich text support
    * TableElement enhanced with cellWidth/cellHeight properties
* [🚧] **Event System**: Partial implementation, needs consolidation
* [🚧] **IPC Commands**: Basic implementation, needs refinement

## 🎨 Canvas Tools

* [cite_start][✅] **Section Tool**: Absolute coords, `<Group>`-based, drag parenting [cite: 2]
* [✅] **Connector Tool**: Memoized routes, smart snap points, auto-update
* [cite_start][✅] **Pen Tool**: Throttled drawing, optimized path caching [cite: 2]
* [✅] **Table Tool**: Enhanced data model, cell CRUD via store
* [✅] **Image Tool**: Upload/drag-drop pipeline, validation
* [✅] **Basic Shapes**: Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Star with node reuse

## 🔧 Reliability & Testing

* [✅] **TypeScript Compilation**: Zero errors achieved in Phase 2
* [✅] **Production Build**: Successful (51s build time)
* [✅] **Vitest Suite**: Robust integration testing framework
    * Real store instances (no global mocks)
    * Vanilla Zustand testing patterns
    * 83/83 tests passing with authentic validation
* [🚧] **Performance Monitoring**: Components in place, needs integration
* [🚧] **Memory Management**: Basic implementation, optimization pending

## 🚦 Critical Fixes Validation

* [✅] **Phase 0**: Duplicate file removal completed
    * SimpleTextEditor.tsx, EnhancedCacheManager.ts, tableStore.ts removed
    * 352+ lines of duplicate code eliminated
* [✅] **Phase 1**: Type consolidation completed  
    * enhanced.types.ts established as single source of truth
    * Circular dependency risks resolved
* [✅] **Phase 2**: TypeScript discriminated union fixes completed
    * All compilation errors resolved
    * Type-safe component interfaces implemented
    * Proper type guards throughout codebase

## 🔧 Next Phase Priorities

* **Phase 3**: Import standardization and performance optimization
    * Consolidate import paths to use enhanced.types.ts
    * Optimize component re-rendering patterns
    * Implement granular selectors
* **Phase 4**: Store architecture cleanup
    * Unify drawing state management
    * Consolidate performance monitoring
    * Optimize memory usage patterns
* **Cross-Browser Security Audit**: File upload review

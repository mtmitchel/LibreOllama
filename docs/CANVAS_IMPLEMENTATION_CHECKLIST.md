## üéØ **ESSENTIAL INTEGRATION FIXES - Real Issues from Testing**

### **üîß Critical Integration Issues (Fix These First)**

**Root Cause**: Testing revealed that **store logic works perfectly** but **UI-backend integration has 7 specific disconnects**.

1. **‚ùå Element Drop Logic Integration Issue**
   - **Problem**: `handleElementDrop` not updating element positions in store
   - **Impact**: Drag operations fail silently in production
   - **Fix Location**: `CanvasEventHandler.tsx` - connect drop events to store updates
   - **Test**: `npm run test -- section-ui-integration.test.ts`

2. **‚úÖ Cross-Store Registration Issue - FIXED**  
   - **Problem**: Sections created in section store but not registered in elements store
   - **Impact**: "Element not found for update" runtime errors
   - **Fix Location**: Enhanced store `addElement` method - automatic cross-store registration
   - **Fix Applied**: Added override to automatically register elements with sectionId in section's childElementIds
   - **Test**: Integration tests should now pass for element-section relationships

3. **‚ùå Element Capture Logic Gap**
   - **Problem**: `captureElementsAfterSectionCreation` not assigning elements to sections  
   - **Impact**: FigJam-like auto-capture behavior not working
   - **Fix Location**: Section capture workflow - fix element assignment logic
   - **Test**: Integration tests show logic gap in element-to-section assignment

4. **‚ùå Section Structure Initialization Issue**
   - **Problem**: `section.childElementIds` is `undefined` instead of `[]`
   - **Impact**: Runtime errors when iterating over child elements
   - **Fix Location**: Section creation - ensure proper array initialization
   - **Test**: Integration tests confirm structure defaults missing

5. **‚ùå UI Event Handling Disconnect**
   - **Problem**: DOM events not triggering canvas callbacks
   - **Impact**: User interactions not processed correctly  
   - **Fix Location**: Event binding between UI components and CanvasEventHandler
   - **Test**: Integration tests show UI-backend event disconnection

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Secondary Integration Issues**

6. **Element Movement Cascade Issue**
   - **Problem**: Moving sections not updating child element positions
   - **Impact**: Child elements don't move with parent sections
   - **Fix Location**: Section movement workflow

7. **Selection State Synchronization**
   - **Problem**: Selection state not synchronized between UI and stores
   - **Impact**: Visual selection not matching backend selection state
   - **Fix Location**: Selection event handlers and visual feedback

### **‚úÖ Already Working (Confirmed by Tests - Don't Touch)**
- ‚úÖ Zustand store architecture (50/50 tests passing)  
- ‚úÖ Core store operations (all CRUD working)

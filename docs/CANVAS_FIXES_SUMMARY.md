# LibreOllama Canvas System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes and enhancements made to the LibreOllama canvas system to address all reported issues and deliver a production-ready implementation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Broken Editing Flow**

### 2. ✅ **Editing Mode Visual Clarity**
- Added **background blur overlay** when editing (subtle 2px blur)
- **Prominent white border with shadow** around the editing textarea
- **Dimmed original text** (opacity 0.3) while editing
- **Visual resize hints** on selected elements (blue bars on sides)
- **Keyboard shortcuts hint** displayed below textarea

### 3. ✅ **Resizable Elements**
- **Text elements**: Horizontal resizing only (preserves readability)
- **Sticky notes**: Full resizing with all 8 handles
- **Visual cues**: Blue resize hint bars appear on selection
- **Cursor changes**: Shows move cursor on hover when selected
- **Transformer integration**: Fixed Group node selection for proper transform handling

### 4. ✅ **Polished RTF Context Menu**

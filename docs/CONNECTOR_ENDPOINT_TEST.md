# Connector Endpoint Adjustment Test Plan

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented connector endpoint adjustment functionality with the following features:

### 1. ConnectorHandles Service (src/features/canvas/services/ConnectorHandles.ts)
- Visual handles for dragging connector endpoints
- Hover effects (scale and cursor change)
- Preview line during dragging
- Callbacks for position updates

### 2. Store Integration (unifiedCanvasStore.ts)
- Updated connector drag state to work with edges
- `beginEndpointDrag`: Start dragging an edge endpoint
- `updateEndpointDrag`: Update position with optional snap target
- `commitEndpointDrag`: Commit changes to edge
- `cancelEndpointDrag`: Cancel drag operation

### 3. Renderer Integration (CanvasRendererV2.ts)
- `renderConnectorHandles`: Renders blue handles at edge endpoints
- `createConnectorHandle`: Creates draggable handles with:
  - Port snapping (20px snap distance)
  - Visual feedback (green when snapping, blue when free)
  - Preview updates during drag
  - Proper event handling

### 4. Edge Module Updates
- Works with edge system instead of legacy connectors
- Supports both connected and free-floating edges
- Proper endpoint updates with port kinds

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Endpoint Dragging
1. Create two shapes (circles or rectangles)
2. Draw a connector between them
3. Select the connector
4. Blue handles should appear at both endpoints
5. Drag a handle - it should move smoothly
6. Release to commit the new position

### Test 2: Port Snapping
1. Create multiple shapes
2. Draw a connector between two shapes
3. Select the connector
4. Drag an endpoint near another shape's port
5. Handle should snap to port (turns green)
6. Release to connect to the new port

### Test 3: Free-Floating Endpoints
1. Draw a connector between two shapes
2. Select the connector
3. Drag an endpoint away from all shapes
4. Endpoint should become free-floating
5. Connector should still render correctly

### Test 4: Visual Feedback
1. Select a connector
2. Hover over handles - they should scale up
3. Cursor should change to "grab"
4. During drag, handle color changes:
   - Blue: free position
   - Green: snapping to port

### Test 5: Multiple Connectors
1. Create several connectors
2. Select one connector at a time
3. Each should have its own handles
4. Dragging one shouldn't affect others

## Known Features
- ✅ Endpoint dragging with visual handles
- ✅ Port snapping with visual feedback
- ✅ Free-floating endpoint support
- ✅ Preview during drag
- ✅ Hover effects and cursor changes
- ✅ Integration with edge system
- ✅ Proper store updates

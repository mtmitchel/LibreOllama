- **Smart Suggestions**: Proactive workflow guidance
- **Status Indicators**: Clear feedback on system and workflow state

## ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

### Workflow States
- `chat`: AI conversations and interactions
- `agents`: AI agent creation and management
- `folders`: Content organization and structure
- `notes`: Documentation and knowledge management
- `n8n`: Workflow automation and integration
- `mcp`: MCP server management and tools
- `models`: Model installation and configuration
- `templates`: Chat template and prompt management
- `analytics`: Performance monitoring and insights
- `settings`: Application configuration and preferences

### Cross-Feature Integration
Each workflow includes smart suggestions for related features:
- **Chat â†’ Notes**: Save conversations as documentation
- **Chat â†’ Agents**: Create agents from conversation patterns
- **Agents â†’ Templates**: Convert agent configs to reusable templates
- **Notes â†’ Folders**: Organize documentation structurally
- **Analytics â†’ All**: Performance insights for any workflow

## ðŸš€ SUCCESS CRITERIA MET

âœ… **Single Unified Interface**: Replaced tab navigation with workflow-state management

âœ… **Focus Mode**: Successfully reduces visual clutter for deep work
âœ… **Seamless Integration**: All existing features work within unified workspace
âœ… **ADHD-Friendly Design**: Generous whitespace, calm colors, large targets, clear hierarchy
âœ… **Immediate Feedback**: Visual confirmation for all user interactions
âœ… **Cross-Feature Connections**: Intelligent workflow suggestions and transitions

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Component Structure
```
UnifiedWorkspace (Main Layout Container)
â”œâ”€â”€ Header (Hidden in focus mode)
â”œâ”€â”€ SmartActionBar (Context-aware actions)
â”œâ”€â”€ Main Content Area (70% width, 100% in focus mode)

â””â”€â”€ ContextualSidebar (30% width, hidden in focus mode)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Quick Actions
    â”œâ”€â”€ Smart Suggestions
    â”œâ”€â”€ Recent Activity
    â””â”€â”€ Cross-Feature Connections
```

### State Management
- **Workflow Context**: Centralized context object tracking current state
- **Focus Mode**: Boolean state controlling UI visibility
- **Recent Activity**: Array of recent workflow interactions

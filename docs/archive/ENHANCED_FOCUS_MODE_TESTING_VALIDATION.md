- ✅ **Sentence Highlighting**: Visual feedback for current sentence
- ✅ **Pomodoro Timer**: Integrated timer with session management
- ✅ **Distraction Elimination**: Clean, minimal UI when active
- ✅ **Accessibility Support**: Respects reduced motion and high contrast preferences

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- ✅ `Escape`: Exit focus mode
- ✅ `Ctrl+.` (or `Cmd+.`): Toggle focus mode
- ✅ `Ctrl+Shift+F`: Toggle focus mode (alternative)
- ✅ `Ctrl+T`: Toggle typewriter scrolling (focus mode only)
- ✅ `Ctrl+H`: Toggle sentence highlighting (focus mode only)
- ✅ `Ctrl+P`: Toggle Pomodoro timer (focus mode only)

### Density Modes
- ✅ **Compact**: Reduced spacing, smaller fonts
- ✅ **Comfortable**: Balanced spacing and typography
- ✅ **Spacious**: Increased spacing for better readability

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Demo Page Access

Access the validation demo at: `/components/focus/FocusValidationDemo`

The demo page includes:
- Interactive testing area with sample text
- Real-time feature status indicators
- Keyboard shortcut testing with visual feedback
- Accessibility preference detection
- Pomodoro timer integration
- Quick action buttons

### 2. Manual Testing Procedures

#### A. Focus Mode Activation
1. **Via Keyboard**: Press `Ctrl+.` or `Ctrl+Shift+F`
2. **Via UI**: Click the focus mode toggle switch
3. **Expected**: UI simplifies, focus CSS is applied

#### B. Typewriter Scrolling
1. Enable typewriter scrolling
2. Click in the testing text area
3. Type several lines of text or move cursor with arrow keys
4. **Expected**: Cursor stays in upper 40% of viewport
5. **Performance**: Smooth scrolling without lag

#### C. Sentence Highlighting
1. Enable sentence highlighting
2. Click in the testing text area
3. Move cursor through different sentences
4. **Expected**: Current sentence highlighted with subtle background
5. **Accessibility**: Highlighting respects reduced motion preferences

#### D. Pomodoro Timer
1. Enable Pomodoro timer feature
2. Start a focus session
3. Test pause/resume functionality
4. Test skip session button
5. Test reset timer button
6. **Expected**: 
   - Timer counts down accurately
   - Visual progress bar updates
   - Session transitions work correctly
   - Notifications appear when sessions complete

#### E. Accessibility Testing
1. **Reduced Motion**: 
   - Set OS preference to "reduce motion"
   - Verify animations are disabled
   - Check that highlighting transitions are instant
2. **High Contrast**:
   - Enable high contrast mode in OS
   - Verify text remains readable
   - Check that highlighting still works

### 3. Keyboard Shortcut Validation

The demo page includes real-time shortcut testing:

1. **Focus Mode Toggles**:
   - Press `Escape` (should exit if active)
   - Press `Ctrl+.` (should toggle)
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (should toggle)

2. **Feature Toggles** (Focus mode must be active):
   - Press `Ctrl+T` (typewriter scrolling)
   - Press `Ctrl+H` (sentence highlighting)
   - Press `Ctrl+P` (Pomodoro timer)

3. **Visual Feedback**: Green highlighting shows when shortcuts are detected

### 4. Performance Testing

#### A. Typewriter Scrolling Performance
- Type rapidly in the test area
- Move cursor quickly with arrow keys
- **Expected**: No lag or stuttering
- **Metrics**: Smooth 60fps scrolling

#### B. Sentence Highlighting Performance
- Move cursor rapidly through text
- Type and delete text quickly
- **Expected**: Highlighting updates smoothly
- **Debouncing**: Should not flicker with rapid changes

#### C. Memory Usage
- Enable all features simultaneously
- Type extensively in the test area
- **Expected**: No memory leaks or excessive usage

### 5. Integration Testing

#### A. Component Integration
- Test focus mode in Notes component
- Test focus mode in Chat interface
- Test focus mode in Task management
- **Expected**: Features work consistently across components

#### B. State Persistence
- Enable features and refresh page
- **Expected**: Settings should persist (if implemented)

#### C. Multi-Instance Testing
- Open multiple tabs/windows
- Test focus mode in each
- **Expected**: Each instance operates independently

## Validation Criteria

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- All keyboard shortcuts are responsive
- Typewriter scrolling keeps cursor in view
- Sentence highlighting works accurately
- Pomodoro timer functions correctly
- Density modes change typography appropriately
- Accessibility preferences are respected

### ✅ Performance Requirements
- Smooth scrolling without frame drops
- Responsive highlighting without lag
- Memory usage remains stable
- No blocking operations on main thread

### ✅ Accessibility Requirements
- Reduced motion preferences honored
- High contrast mode supported
- Keyboard navigation works properly
- Screen reader compatibility maintained

### ✅ Code Quality Requirements
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- Proper type exports available
- Clean component architecture
- Comprehensive error handling

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **State Persistence**: Focus mode settings reset on page refresh
2. **Multi-Monitor**: Typewriter scrolling may need adjustment for multi-monitor setups
3. **Mobile Support**: Current implementation optimized for desktop use

### Future Enhancements
1. **Custom Shortcuts**: Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts
2. **Sound Integration**: Optional audio cues for Pomodoro timer
3. **Focus Profiles**: Save and load different focus mode configurations
4. **Advanced Metrics**: Track focus session analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Typewriter Scrolling Not Working
- Ensure element has proper focus
- Check that cursor is visible
- Verify scroll container has height

#### Sentence Highlighting Not Visible
- Check CSS styles are loaded
- Verify highlight color contrast
- Ensure text content is selectable

#### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Responding
- Check for conflicting browser shortcuts
- Verify focus is on the page/element
- Ensure focus mode is active for feature-specific shortcuts

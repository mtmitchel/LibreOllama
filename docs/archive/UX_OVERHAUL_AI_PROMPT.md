Prompt for AI Agent: LibreOllama Workspace UI/UX TransformationProject: LibreOllama Workspace - UI/UX OverhaulObjective: You are tasked with assisting in a comprehensive UI/UX transformation of the LibreOllama Workspace application. The goal is to evolve the existing application into a modern, clean, integrated, intuitive, and visually coherent workspace, prioritizing user experience, especially for users with ADHD. The backend architecture is to remain largely intact, so this is primarily a frontend/UX overhaul. We will be following a hybrid implementation strategy.Core Product Vision:LibreOllama Workspace aims to be a seamless, intelligent, and integrated digital environment. It empowers users to think, create, organize, and collaborate with unprecedented efficiency, augmented by local and cloud-based AI. Key principles include:AI Integration: Deeply embedded AI assistance for content, research, coding, etc.Privacy-First: Prioritizing local data and user control.Integrated Workflow: Unifying notes, projects, AI chat, whiteboards, calendar, and tasks.Highly Customizable: Adaptable dashboard, themes, and editing experiences.Intuitive & Clean UI/UX: Modern, calming, and easy-to-navigate interface.I. Overall Design System & UI/UX Principles (Target State):Theme:Light Mode (Default): Airy and bright. Primary background: #FFFFFF or very light gray (e.g., #F8F9FA). Secondary surfaces (sidebars, panels): Slightly darker (e.g., #F1F3F5 or #EFF1F3).Dark Mode: Rich and focused. Primary background: Deep charcoal (e.g., #0F172A or #1A1D21 like in our mockups' bg-gray-900). Secondary surfaces: Slightly lighter grays (e.g., #1E293B or #2C313A like our mockups' bg-gray-800).Accent Color: A muted, professional blue (e.g., #2563EB or #4F46E5 from Roo's plan). Used for primary actions, active states, links. Adjust for vibrancy in dark mode.Font: "Inter" (or Nunito Sans as a close alternative). Weights: Regular for body, Medium for titles/important labels, SemiBold/Bold for strong emphasis. Increased line heights for ADHD accessibility.Iconography: "Lucide Icons" (thin line style). Consistent sizing (e.g., 16px inline, 20px navigation, 24px prominent actions). Color: #6B7280 (Light), #9CA3AF (Dark), changing to accent on hover/active.Spacing: 8px base grid unit for all margins, paddings, element spacing.Shadows: Subtle, purposeful for depth (modals, dropdowns, floating elements). E.g., box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 2px 4px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);.Transitions: Smooth and quick (0.2s - 0.3s ease-out).Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA adherence. Clear, consistent focus indicators (e.g., 2px accent-colored ring).Core Components (v2): Standardized buttons, inputs, cards, modals, popovers, etc., reflecting these principles (refer to Button, Card, InputField components in libreOllamaWorkspaceMockup).II. Core Application Layout (Target State):Window: Clean, minimal custom window frame if applicable.Top Bar (TopBar component):Height: ~48px-56px.Background: Differentiated from main content/sidebar (e.g., #FFFFFF with subtle bottom border in Light, #2C313A or bg-gray-800 in Dark).Contents: Global Search input, Theme Toggle (Sun/Moon), Notifications (Bell icon), User Profile dropdown (circular avatar, links to Profile, Settings, Logout).Left Sidebar (LeftSidebar component / PrimaryNavigation.tsx):Width: ~240px (collapsible to ~64px showing icons only).Background: #F8F9FA (Light) / #2C313A or bg-gray-800 (Dark).Navigation Items: Icon (20px) + Label (14px Inter Medium). Padding: ~12px vertical, ~16px horizontal.Active State: Accent color background fill with a small vertical accent bar on the left.Hover State: Slightly lighter background shade.Modules: Dashboard, AI Chat, Projects, Notes, Whiteboards, Calendar, Tasks.Settings icon at the bottom.Main Content Area (<main> tag wrapping CurrentScreen):Background: #FFFFFF (Light) / #0F172A or bg-gray-900 (Dark).Padding: ~24px to ~32px around content.Clear H1/H2 for module titles. Breadcrumbs where appropriate.Right Contextual Panel (Optional, Slide-in):Width: ~300px-350px. Slides in from the right, can overlay or push content.Background: Matches Left Sidebar or slightly lighter than main content.Shadow on its left edge when open.Used for specific contexts like the "Sketch Pad" in Notes or the "Tasks Panel" in Calendar.III. Key Modules & Features (Target State - refer to libreOllamaWorkspaceMockup for component details):Dashboard (DashboardScreen.tsx):Customizable widget grid.Project Snippet Widgets: Display project title, description, color-coded progress bar, and key upcoming milestones.Other widgets: Upcoming Events (list with icons, times, color-coding), Due Tasks (checkboxes, priority dots, due dates), Quick Notes (Markdown input/preview, auto-save indicator), Recent Files.Widgets are Card styled with configuration options (kebab menu).AI Chat Hub (AIChatScreen.tsx):Left Panel (Conversation History):"[+] New Chat" button.List of conversations: Title, Date, Project Tag (if linked).Active/hover states. Pinned chats appear at the top with a pin icon.Context Menu (on hover, top-right of item): Pin/Unpin, Rename, Add to Project..., Export Chat, Delete.Search bar for conversations.Main Chat Area:Top Bar: Active AI Model Name, Model Selector Dropdown.Scrollable chat history with distinct User (right, accent color) and AI (left, gray) message bubbles.Markdown rendering in AI bubbles (code blocks with syntax highlighting & copy button, lists, bold, italics).Copy button for AI messages.Input Area (Bottom): Multi-line text input, Send button, Attach File button, More Options (Clear Context, Delete Current Chat, Export Current Chat).Project Workspace (ProjectWorkspaceScreen.tsx - formerly Project Navigator):Left Panel (Project List): Lists all projects. Selecting a project loads its overview in the main area. "New Project" button. Search for projects.Main Area (Project Overview - Block-Style):Project Title (prominent H1) and editable description.Block-based content: Allows adding sections like:Text/Paragraph blocks for summaries, goals.Timeline Block: Visual representation of project phases (e.g., horizontal bars with status/color-coding).Key Tasks Block: A filtered list of important tasks for this project with status.Linked Resources Block: Links/buttons to associated Notes, Whiteboards, Chats, or specific files within this project.Conceptual "Add Block" and "Drag Block" controls for customizing the overview.Project-specific actions in header (Share, Edit Details, Archive, Delete).Notes (NotesScreen.tsx - Block-Style Editor with Sketching):Left Panel (Notebook/Notes List): Hierarchical list of notebooks (folder icon) and notes (file icon).

Draggable task cards.Task cards show title, due date, priority indicator (colored dot), assignee.List view option."New Task" button. Filtering options.IV. Implementation Strategy Context (Hybrid Approach):Phase 1 (Immediate Priority): Design System FoundationEnhance design-tokens.ts (dark theme, blue accents, spacing, ADHD-optimized typography).Standardize UI Components (create v2 versions of Button, Card, Input, Select, etc., based on mockups and deprecate legacy ones).Implement consistent typography (Inter) and 8px spacing system.Phase 2 (Next Priority): Core Navigation & LayoutImplement the new persistent LeftSidebar (PrimaryNavigation.tsx).Restructure UnifiedWorkspace.tsx for the target three-column (Left Nav, Main Content, Optional Right Context Panel) layout.Implement a global Command Palette (Cmd+K).Reassessment Point: After Phases 1 & 2, user feedback will be collected to guide priorities for Phases 3 & 4.Phases 3 & 4 (Future, informed by reassessment):Feature-Specific Screens: Enhanced Dashboard, Kanban Tasks, Calendar, AI Chat.Advanced Features & Polish: Whiteboard, Enhanced Notes (block editor, sketching), Projects View (project-centric hub), Performance & Polish.V. Current State Snapshot (for context):The application currently has some foundational elements like UnifiedWorkspace.tsx and an initial design-tokens.ts. Some newer components (button-v2.tsx, parts of DashboardScreen.tsx) exist alongside legacy ones, leading to inconsistencies. Key target features like the left sidebar, Kanban, advanced calendar, whiteboard, block-based notes, and the full project workspace hub are largely missing or need significant redesign to match the target UX.Your Task:Please assist in realizing this UI/UX transformation, focusing initially on the tasks outlined for Phases 1 and 2 of the roadmap. This may involve generating React component code (using Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide Icons), refining UI details based on the principles above, providing feedback on implementation strategies, or helping to document the new design system and component APIs. Ensure all generated code is complete, well-commented, and adheres to the specified design principles.

# Enhanced Focus Mode Implementation

## Overview

The Enhanced Focus Mode for LibreOllama Desktop has been successfully implemented with comprehensive ADHD-friendly features. This implementation builds upon the existing focus mode infrastructure in [`UnifiedWorkspace.tsx`](../tauri-app/src/components/UnifiedWorkspace.tsx:1) and extends it with advanced capabilities.

   - Combined hook for applying multiple focus features
   - ADHD-friendly CSS styling utilities
   - Accessibility feature detection (reduced motion, high contrast)
   - Comprehensive focus mode CSS framework

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Typewriter Scrolling (ADHD Requirement)
- **Location**: [`typewriter-scroll.ts`](../tauri-app/src/lib/typewriter-scroll.ts:1)
- **Functionality**: Automatically keeps the current line/cursor in optimal reading position
- **Configuration**: Adjustable center offset (default: 40% from top), smoothness, and threshold
- **Integration**: Works across all text areas (Notes, Chat input, content editing)

### ✅ Sentence Highlighting (ADHD Requirement)
- **Location**: [`sentence-highlight.ts`](../tauri-app/src/lib/sentence-highlight.ts:1)
- **Functionality**: Highlights current sentence being read/edited with subtle blue background
- **Smart Detection**: Uses regex-based sentence boundary detection with grammar awareness
- **Performance**: Debounced updates (150ms) to prevent excessive DOM manipulation

### ✅ Distraction Elimination
- **Location**: [`UnifiedWorkspace.tsx`](../tauri-app/src/components/UnifiedWorkspace.tsx:268-289)
- **Features**:
  - Hides sidebar and context panel in focus mode
  - Minimal top bar with essential controls only
  - Clean, centered content area with optimal reading width
  - Reduced visual clutter and animations

### ✅ Pomodoro Timer Integration
- **Location**: [`PomodoroTimer.tsx`](../tauri-app/src/components/focus/PomodoroTimer.tsx:1)
- **Features**:
  - 25-minute focus sessions with 5-minute breaks
  - Visual progress indicator
  - Session count tracking
  - Gentle break reminders via browser notifications
  - Auto-pause between sessions for user control

### ✅ ADHD-Specific Features
- **Breathing Room**: Configurable density modes (compact, comfortable, spacious)
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- **High Contrast**: Automatic detection and application of high contrast preferences
- **Optimal Typography**: Careful line height, font size, and spacing adjustments
- **Focus Sounds**: Architecture ready for white noise integration

### ✅ Quick Escape Mechanism
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Escape` key to immediately exit focus mode
  - `Ctrl+.` (Cmd+. on Mac) to toggle focus mode
  - `Ctrl+Shift+F` for focus mode activation
  - `Ctrl+K` for command palette access

## Architecture

### Component Integration

```
UnifiedWorkspace (Main Container)
├── useFocusMode() (State Management)
├── useFocusUtilities() (Combined Features)
│   ├── useTypewriterScroll()
│   └── useSentenceHighlight()
├── PomodoroTimer (Optional Timer)
└── Focus Controls Panel (Toggle Features)
```

### State Management

The focus mode state is managed through the [`useFocusMode`](../tauri-app/src/hooks/use-focus-mode.ts:1) hook:

```typescript
interface FocusModeState {
  isActive: boolean;
  options: {
    typewriterScrolling: boolean;
    sentenceHighlighting: boolean;
    pomodoroTimer: boolean;
    reducedMotion: boolean;
    densityMode: 'compact' | 'comfortable' | 'spacious';
  };
  pomodoro: {
    isActive: boolean;
    timeRemaining: number;
    currentSession: 'focus' | 'break';
    sessionCount: number;
  };
}
```

### CSS Framework

Focus mode includes a comprehensive CSS framework in [`focus-utilities.ts`](../tauri-app/src/lib/focus-utilities.ts:120-179):

- `.focus-mode-content` - Base styling for focused content areas
- `.focus-reduced-motion` - Respects reduced motion preferences
- `.focus-high-contrast` - High contrast mode support
- `.focus-density-*` - Density mode variations
- Custom scrollbar styling for better visual consistency

## Usage Examples

### Basic Focus Mode Toggle
```typescript
import { useFocusMode } from '@/hooks/use-focus-mode';

function MyComponent() {
  const { focusMode, toggleFocusMode } = useFocusMode();
  
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleFocusMode}>
      {focusMode.isActive ? 'Exit Focus' : 'Enter Focus'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Text Area with Focus Features
```typescript
import { useFocusUtilities } from '@/lib/focus-utilities';

function FocusAwareTextArea() {
  const focusUtilities = useFocusUtilities({ autoApply: true });
  
  return (
    <div 
      ref={focusUtilities.ref}
      contentEditable
      className="focus-mode-content"
    >
      {/* Content with automatic typewriter scrolling and sentence highlighting */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Integration Points

### ✅ Chat Interface
- Focus utilities can be applied to chat input areas
- Message composition benefits from typewriter scrolling
- Sentence highlighting assists with longer message composition

### ✅ Notes Editor
- Full integration with [`BlockEditor.tsx`](../tauri-app/src/components/notes/BlockEditor.tsx:1)
- Typewriter scrolling for long-form writing
- Sentence highlighting for editing and proofreading

### ✅ Task View
- Simplified single-task focus view in focus mode
- Distraction-free task management interface

### ✅ Command Palette
- Quick focus mode activation via [`CommandPalette`](../tauri-app/src/components/ui/command-palette.tsx:1)
- Keyboard shortcuts integration

## Accessibility Compliance

### ✅ Motion Preferences
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Disables animations and smooth scrolling when requested
- Provides instant transitions for motion-sensitive users

### ✅ Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard accessibility maintained in focus mode
- Logical tab order preserved
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels

### ✅ Visual Accessibility
- High contrast mode detection and support
- Customizable color schemes
- Scalable interface with density controls

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Debounced Updates**: Sentence highlighting and typewriter scrolling use debouncing to prevent excessive DOM updates
- **Efficient Selectors**: CSS-based animations and transitions minimize JavaScript execution
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- **Lazy Loading**: Focus features only activate when focus mode is enabled

### Resource Usage
- Minimal CPU impact during normal operation
- Efficient memory usage with proper cleanup
- No network requests for core functionality
- Battery-friendly with optimized animation handling

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Focus Sounds Integration**: White noise and ambient sounds
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed focus session tracking and insights
3. **Customizable Themes**: Additional color schemes and visual styles
4. **Focus Goals**: Target-based session management
5. **Team Features**: Shared focus sessions and productivity insights

### Extension Points
- Plugin architecture for custom focus features
- API hooks for third-party integrations
- Configurable focus mode presets
- Integration with productivity tools

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing Completed ✅
- Focus mode activation/deactivation

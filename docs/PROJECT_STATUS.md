# LibreOllama Project Status

**Last Updated**: August 6, 2025  
**Purpose**: Consolidated project status and implementation guide

## 🎨 Design System Migration (Asana)

**Status**: 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** - Migrating from Linear/Obsidian to Asana design system

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created Asana design token system and CSS files
- ✅ Implemented backwards compatibility layer
- ✅ Created page-specific Asana styles
- ✅ Archived old design system files

**In Progress**:
- 🔄 Updating component JSX to use Asana classes
- 🔄 Fixing Sidebar to use light Asana design (currently dark purple)
- 🔄 Applying proper color scheme (white backgrounds, purple accents only)
- 🔄 Updating typography and spacing to match Asana's clean aesthetic

**Known Issues**:
- ⚠️ Components still using Tailwind classes instead of Asana classes
- ⚠️ Sidebar using dark theme instead of light
- ⚠️ Excessive purple usage (should be accent only)
- ⚠️ Typography and spacing don't match Asana standards

Current limitations / in progress:
- Advanced connector styles and full transform snapping
- Table tool UX not implemented; Section tool disabled
- MemoryManager and KonvaDirectRenderer exist but not yet wired
- Legacy react-konva tests/components present; not used in runtime

Architecture:
- Modular unified store with Zustand + Immer

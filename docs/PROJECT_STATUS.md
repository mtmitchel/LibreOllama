# LibreOllama Project Status

**Last Updated**: August 28, 2025
**Purpose**: Consolidated project status and implementation guide

## 🎨 Design System Migration (Asana)

**Status**: 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** - Migrating from Linear/Obsidian to Asana design system

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created Asana design token system and CSS files
- ✅ Implemented backwards compatibility layer
- ✅ Created page-specific Asana styles
- ✅ Archived old design system files

**In Progress**:
- 🔄 Updating component JSX to use Asana classes
- 🔄 Fixing Sidebar to use light Asana design (currently dark purple)
- 🔄 Applying proper color scheme (white backgrounds, purple accents only)
- 🔄 Updating typography and spacing to match Asana's clean aesthetic

**Known Issues**:
- ⚠️ Components still using Tailwind classes instead of Asana classes
- ⚠️ Sidebar using dark theme instead of light
- ⚠️ Excessive purple usage (should be accent only)
- ⚠️ Typography and spacing don't match Asana standards

- **Test Suite**: ✅ **94.3% pass rate** (397/421 tests passing)
- **Test Infrastructure**: ✅ Fully functional with all dependencies
- **Code Coverage**: Good coverage across core functionality
- **Known Issues**: 24 failing tests (Google API mocks needed)

## Current Implementation Status

### 🤖 AI Writing Tools
**Status**: ✅ Core functionality implemented, ready for production

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Context-aware AI writing menu across all text inputs (except Notes page)
- ✅ 13 AI writing actions (rewrite, translate, summarize, etc.)
- ✅ Direct LLM integration with multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral)
- ✅ Sophisticated output modal with markdown rendering
- ✅ Language selection for translations with retranslate functionality
- ✅ AI Writing settings in Settings page for default model selection
- ✅ Text replacement with full selection range preservation
- ✅ Clean LLM responses without preamble text
- ✅ Proper modal state management (no unmounting/remounting)
- ✅ React 17+ portal event handling fixed
- ✅ Response caching for improved performance
- ✅ Model-specific prompt optimization

**Architecture**:
- Components in `src/components/ai/`
- LLM providers in `src/services/llm/`
- Settings integration in `src/app/pages/Settings.tsx`
- BlockNote integration in `src/features/notes/components/BlockNotePopover.tsx`

### 🎯 Canvas System
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION-READY** - Core functionality is stable, with a clear plan for next-level performance enhancements.

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **Modern Architecture**: A modular system built on React, Konva, and a highly optimized Zustand store.
- ✅ **Rich Feature Set**: 15+ element types, advanced drawing tools (pen, highlighter, eraser), smart connectors, sections, and image support.
- ✅ **Performant Rendering Pipeline**: A consolidated layer system (`Background`, `Main`, `Overlay`) plus a dedicated, GPU-accelerated `FastLayer` for images.
- ✅ **Advanced Optimizations**: Viewport culling via a `useSpatialIndex` QuadTree, a `KonvaNodePool` for reusing objects, and low-level performance settings are all implemented.
- ✅ **Robust State Management**: A modular 8-module Zustand store with `immer` provides predictable and performant state handling.
- ✅ **Reliable Persistence**: Autosaving to the local filesystem via Tauri, with AES-256-GCM encryption.
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Strong test coverage for canvas components and state logic.
- ✅ **Migration Progress**: Phase 1 completed with NonReactCanvasStage implementation and imperative drawing pipeline.

**Architecture Summary**:
- The architecture is defined by a `CanvasStage` that manages a `CanvasLayerManager`.
- The manager performs spatial culling and distributes visible elements to the appropriate layer (`MainLayer`, `FastLayer`, `OverlayLayer`).
- State is centralized in an 8-module `unifiedCanvasStore`.
- **Current Migration**: Following the KONVA_BASED_CANVAS.md blueprint to migrate from react-konva to direct Konva usage.
- **Status**: Phase 1 (Fresh Core) completed, Phase 2 (State Bridge) in progress.

**Future Performance Enhancements (Based on Performance Plan)**:
- A forward-looking performance plan is in place to further optimize the canvas.
- Key initiatives include implementing **batch rendering** for shapes, using **custom Tauri protocols** to accelerate saving/loading large canvases, and tuning the **spatial index with adaptive thresholds**.
- **Migration Blueprint**: Following the comprehensive KONVA_BASED_CANVAS.md plan for systematic migration to direct Konva usage.

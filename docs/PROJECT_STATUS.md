- ✅ Core tools: Text, Sticky Notes, Sections, Connectors, Pen tool
- ✅ Selection and transformation system
- ✅ Undo/redo functionality
- ✅ Layer management system
- ✅ Performance optimizations (viewport culling, memory management)

**Known Issues**:
- 🔄 Some tool consistency issues under intensive use
- 🔄 Transform handles occasionally need reselection
- 🔄 Element movement can be inconsistent

**Architecture**: 
- Unified store pattern with Zustand + Immer
- Centralized event handling via UnifiedEventHandler
- Component-based layer system (Background, Main, Connector, UI)

### 📋 Tasks Management System
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION-READY** - Complete overhaul with professional-grade implementation

**What's Working**:
- ✅ **Dedicated drag handles** with clean interaction separation
- ✅ **Full task CRUD operations** - create, edit, complete, delete all working correctly
- ✅ **LocalStorage persistence** - all changes survive page refreshes
- ✅ **Professional drag-and-drop** using @dnd-kit with visual feedback
- ✅ **Comprehensive task metadata** - priority, labels, subtasks, recurring tasks
- ✅ **Timezone-correct date handling** - dates display correctly without timezone shifts
- ✅ **Performance optimized** with React.memo, useCallback, and efficient re-renders
- ✅ **Responsive design** with three default columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- ✅ **Rich task modal** with full metadata editing capabilities
- ✅ **Visual drag feedback** with rotation, shadows, and overlay preview
- ✅ **Kanban and List view modes** with toggle functionality
- ✅ **Real-time updates** with optimistic UI updates

**Recent Major Fixes (January 2025)**:
- 🔧 **Fixed interaction conflicts** - separated drag handles from click areas
- 🔧 **Implemented localStorage persistence** - replaced mock service with permanent storage
- 🔧 **Fixed date timezone issues** - July 21st now displays as July 21st
- 🔧 **Added performance optimizations** - memoized components and callbacks
- 🔧 **Professional UX improvements** - tooltips, visual feedback, clean separation of concerns

**Architecture**: 
- Unified Zustand store with localStorage persistence
- Professional component separation with dedicated drag handles
- Optimistic updates with error handling
- Type-safe metadata system

### 📅 Calendar & Tasks Integration
**Status**: Simplified store architecture implemented - Ready for integration

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Google Calendar integration with FullCalendar
- ✅ Google Tasks Kanban board with drag-and-drop between columns
- ✅ Real API services (not mock) with TypeScript types
- ✅ Multi-account support in UI
- ✅ Task creation, completion, and basic management
- ✅ Calendar event display and basic creation
- ✅ Tasks sidebar in Calendar page (displays tasks)
- ✅ **Simplified unified store architecture** with 7 passing tests
- ✅ **Optimistic updates** with rollback capability
- ✅ **Metadata encoding** in task notes field
- ✅ **Feature flag system** for gradual migration

**Missing from Original Scope**:
- ❌ **Drag-and-drop time blocking** - Tasks can be dragged in sidebar but not dropped onto calendar
- ❌ **"Schedule Task" modal** - No modal opens when dropping tasks on calendar dates
- ❌ **Time input functionality** - No start/end time selection for converting tasks to events
- ❌ **Task-to-event conversion** - Core workflow from scope is not implemented
- ❌ **Enhanced event creation modal** - Basic prompt instead of full modal
- ❌ **Task completion from calendar** - Can't mark tasks complete from calendar view

**Implementation Gap**:
The current implementation provides two separate functional systems (Tasks Kanban + Calendar display) but lacks the integrated workflow that was the core value proposition of the original scope. The drag-and-drop time blocking feature that would allow users to schedule tasks by dragging them onto calendar dates is completely missing.

**Implementation Details**:
- Services in `src/services/google/` with real and mock implementations
- Legacy store in `src/stores/googleStore.ts` with Zustand
- **New simplified store** in `src/stores/useKanbanStore.ts` with unified architecture
- **Feature flags** in `src/stores/featureFlags.ts` for gradual migration
- **Task bridge** in `src/stores/useTaskStore.ts` for smooth transition
- Types defined in `src/types/google.ts`
- Calendar page uses FullCalendar v6 with basic task sidebar
- Tasks page has functional Kanban layout with intra-column drag-and-drop
- **Comprehensive test suite** in `src/stores/__tests__/useKanbanStore.test.ts`

#### Tasks Management Testing Status
- **Current Status**: ✅ **7 passing tests** for production-ready localStorage implementation
- **Architecture Evolution**: Successfully evolved from complex mock-based system to simple, reliable localStorage
- **Key Achievement**: Production-ready task management with persistent data storage

#### Production-Ready Implementation
**Current Architecture**:

- **State Subscription**: Use `useKanbanStore.subscribe()` for change tracking
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Test persistence layer directly
- **Focus on Business Logic**: Test actual functionality users experience

#### Root Cause Analysis Summary
**Previous Issues**:
- Over-engineered layering (Store → Service → Worker → API)
- Complex mock infrastructure causing test failures
- Mismatch between mock behavior and production code
- Retrofit testing approach on existing complex architecture

**Solution**:
- **localStorage Persistence**: Immediate, reliable data storage without API complexity
- **Professional UX Patterns**: Dedicated drag handles, clean interaction separation
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo, useCallback, efficient re-renders
- **Simple, Reliable Architecture**: Less complexity, more reliability

**Impact**: 
- From 4 failing tests to 7 passing tests with production-ready implementation
- Users can now reliably create, edit, and manage tasks with persistence
- Professional-grade UX with proper drag-and-drop and interaction patterns
- Zero data loss - all changes survive page refreshes

#### Backend Testing
- Command: `cd src-tauri && cargo test --lib -- --nocapture`
- Status: 40 passing, 2 failing (OAuth config and Gmail scopes)
- Architecture: Service-oriented with proper separation

#### Testing Commands
- **Backend**: `cd src-tauri && cargo test --lib -- --nocapture`
- **Frontend**: `npm test -- --run`
- **Canvas specific**: Focus on store-first testing approach
- **Tasks Management (Production)**: `npm test -- --run src/stores/__tests__/useKanbanStore.test.ts`
- **Tasks Legacy (Calendar integration)**: `npm test -- --run src/features/tasks/tests/`

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Canvas**: Use unified store pattern and test store actions directly
- **Gmail**: Backend services handle all API interactions, test via Tauri commands
- **Tasks Management**: Test store methods directly via `useKanbanStore.getState()`, focus on localStorage persistence
- **Tasks Legacy**: Initialize store state properly in tests, mock API calls correctly
- **General**: Focus on business logic over infrastructure, use direct store testing when possible

### **🧪 Unit Test Infrastructure Repair (ACTIVE DEBUGGING - June 20, 2025)**

**Objective**: Restore the Jest test suite to a fully operational state with a sustainable, long-term architecture.

#### **✅ Major Accomplishments:**

*   **Jest Configuration Overhaul**:
    *   ✅ Resolved critical ESM/TypeScript configuration conflicts that prevented the test suite from running.
    *   ✅ Created a dedicated `tsconfig.jest.json` to correctly process test files with `ts-jest`, enabling proper TypeScript feature support (including JSX) within the test environment.
    *   ✅ Corrected module path alias (`@/`) resolution in `jest.config.js` to match the application's source code structure.

*   **Architectural Decision - Namespace Import Strategy**:
    *   ✅ **Long-term Solution**: Standardized on namespace imports (`import * as Module from '...'`) for all store slices across the entire codebase.
    *   ✅ **Benefits**: Ensures consistent module resolution in both test and production environments, eliminates configuration workarounds, provides explicit module namespacing, and future-proofs against toolchain changes.
    *   ✅ **Implementation**: Updated `canvasStore.enhanced.ts` and test files to use consistent namespace imports with clear architectural documentation.

*   **Module Resolution Fixes**:
    *   ✅ Systematically resolved `TypeError: ... is not a function` errors by implementing the namespace import pattern throughout the codebase.
    *   ✅ Fixed test utility imports and path resolution issues.
    *   ✅ Applied consistent import patterns to both test files and core store implementations.

*   **Test Suite Progress**:
    *   ✅ **Increased Passing Tests from 0 to 66+ (out of 137)** - Major improvement in test reliability.
    *   ✅ Enabled test suites for major stores (`canvasElementsStore`, `canvasHistoryStore`, `selectionStore`) to run and pass consistently.
    *   🔄 **Active Issue**: `viewportStore` test suite experiencing "initializer is not a function" errors due to export/import mismatch.

#### **🚨 Current Critical Issue - ViewportStore Test Failure:**

**Problem**: `TypeError: initializer is not a function` in `viewportStore.test.ts`
*   **Root Cause**: `createViewportStore` export is undefined in test context despite being properly exported from source file
*   **Debug Status**: Confirmed export exists in source, namespace import pattern attempted, compilation dependencies being investigated
*   **Impact**: 8 test failures preventing validation of critical viewport functionality (zoom, pan, coordinate transformations)

**Investigation Progress**:
*   ✅ Verified export statement exists in `viewportStore.ts` at line 72: `export const createViewportStore: StateCreator<...>`
*   ✅ Attempted both direct and namespace import patterns (`import { createViewportStore }` vs `import * as ViewportStore`)
*   ✅ Confirmed path aliases are correctly configured in `jest.config.js` with `'^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1'`
*   ✅ Debug logging shows `createViewportStore` as `undefined` while other exports like `useViewportStore` are present (but mocked)
*   🔄 **Active**: Investigating TypeScript compilation chain and potential circular dependencies
*   🔄 **Active**: Comparing with working `canvasElementsStore` test pattern for architectural differences
*   🔄 **Active**: Examining potential Jest mock interference preventing real exports from loading

**Technical Details**:
*   **Error Pattern**: `TypeError: initializer is not a function` at `create<ViewportState>()(immer(createViewportStore))`
*   **Zustand Pattern**: Using `create` with `immer` middleware, identical to working stores
*   **Jest Config**: ESM support enabled with `ts-jest/presets/default-esm` and `extensionsToTreatAsEsm: ['.ts', '.tsx']`
*   **Module Resolution**: Path aliases working (confirmed by successful type imports), but function exports failing

#### **� Current Test Suite Status (June 20, 2025):**

**Overall Test Health**: 
*   **Working Stores**: `canvasElementsStore`, `canvasHistoryStore`, `selectionStore` - All tests passing
*   **Failing Store**: `viewportStore` - 8/8 tests failing due to export issue
*   **Component Tests**: Mixed status, some blocked by DOM simulation issues
*   **Hook Tests**: Partially working, some Tauri API mock issues

**Critical Path**: `viewportStore` test resolution is blocking validation of:
*   Zoom functionality (setZoom, zoomIn, zoomOut)
*   Pan functionality (setPan, resetViewport)  
*   Coordinate transformations (screenToCanvas, canvasToScreen)
*   Viewport state management and boundaries

#### **🎉 BREAKTHROUGH: ViewportStore Tests Now Passing! (June 20, 2025)**

**CRITICAL SUCCESS**: The comprehensive testing guide's solutions worked perfectly! The `viewportStore` export/import issue has been **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**.

- ✅ **EditableNode Pattern**: Unified interaction wrapper for all shape components
- ✅ **Import Path Resolution**: Fixed all build conflicts and import issues

#### 🔴 Critical Architectural Refactoring Tasks (Blocking Performance)

**1. Decompose Monolithic KonvaCanvas.tsx Component**
- **Issue**: 2000+ line component hinders maintenance and performance optimization
- **Target Architecture**:
  ```
  <CanvasContainer>       # Data fetching & store setup
    <Stage>               # Konva stage management
      <LayerManager>      # Multi-layer architecture
        <NodeRenderer>    # Iterates node IDs, dispatches to shapes
          <ShapeComponent id={id} />  # Memoized, self-subscribing
            <RectangleNode>, <TextNode>, etc.
  ```
- **Impact**: Enables granular re-renders, improves maintainability
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Foundation for all other optimizations
- **Effort**: Large (2-3 days)

**2. Implement React.memo with Explicit Props Strategy**
- **Current Anti-Pattern**: `<Rect {...konvaElementProps} />` defeats React.memo
- **Required Pattern**: `<Rect x={node.x} y={node.y} width={node.width} fill={node.fill} />`
- **Rule**: Shape components must subscribe to their own state via `id` prop
- **Impact**: Prevents cascade re-renders when single shape changes
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Core performance fix
- **Effort**: Medium (1-2 days)

**3. Restructure Zustand Store for O(1) Performance**
- **Current**: Arrays for element storage (O(n) lookup)
- **Required**: Object maps `Record<string, NodeData>` (O(1) lookup)
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  interface CanvasState {
    elements: Record<string, NodeData>; // O(1) lookup
    selection: string[];
    // ... other state
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: Eliminates array search bottlenecks as canvas scales
- **Priority**: **HIGH** - Scalability foundation
- **Effort**: Medium (1 day)

**4. Fix Immer Usage Anti-Patterns**
- **Correct Pattern**: Direct draft mutation only
  ```typescript
  updateNodePosition: (nodeId, newPosition) => set((state) => {
    state.elements[nodeId].position = newPosition; // ✓ Correct
  })
  ```
- **Anti-Pattern**: Reassigning state tree parts breaks Immer tracking
- **Impact**: Ensures proper immutability and change detection
- **Priority**: **HIGH** - State consistency
- **Effort**: Small (few hours)

**5. Implement Fine-Grained Selectors**
- **Current**: Components subscribe to entire objects
- **Required**: Subscribe to primitive values only
- **Examples**:
  - Bad: `useStore(state => state.elements[id])`
  - Good: `useStore(state => state.elements[id]?.position.x)`
- **Tool**: Add reselect for memoized computed selectors
- **Impact**: Prevents re-renders from irrelevant state changes
- **Priority**: **HIGH** - Re-render optimization
- **Effort**: Medium (1 day)

## 🧪 Test Suite Development - IN PROGRESS (June 20, 2025)

### **Phase 5C: Jest Test Suite Repair & Modernization - 75% COMPLETE**

**Current Status**: Actively repairing and modernizing the Jest test suite with focus on import path resolution, ESM compatibility, and comprehensive component coverage.

#### **✅ Recently Completed Test Infrastructure**

**1. Import Path Modernization (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ **Alias Implementation**: Updated all test imports to use `@/` path alias instead of relative paths
- ✅ **testUtils Integration**: Fixed `@/tests/utils/testUtils` imports across all test files
- ✅ **Store Import Fixes**: Corrected function names (`createSelectionSlice` → `createSelectionStore`)
- ✅ **Component Import Updates**: Updated shape component imports to use centralized paths

**2. ESM/Jest Configuration Analysis (IN PROGRESS)**
- ✅ **Configuration Review**: Analyzed Jest ESM setup with `useESM: true` and proper transforms
- ✅ **Module Resolution**: Confirmed `@/` alias mapping in Jest config is correct
- ⚠️ **ESM Compatibility**: Identified issues with ES module interop in test environment
- 🔄 **Store Function Resolution**: Working on resolving store creator function imports

**3. Test File Organization (COMPLETED)**
- ✅ **Path Standardization**: All test files now use consistent import patterns
- ✅ **Mock Organization**: Centralized mock patterns for React-Konva components
- ✅ **Test Utils Structure**: Proper testUtils.tsx with mock factories

#### **🔄 Current Test Repair Priorities**

**1. Store Creator Function Resolution (HIGH PRIORITY)**
```typescript
// Issue: Functions not resolving correctly
import { createViewportStore } from '@/features/canvas/stores/slices/viewportStore';
// Error: Cannot find module or function not exported
```
- **Root Cause**: ESM import/export compatibility with Jest environment
- **Solution**: Investigating module resolution and export patterns
- **Status**: Actively debugging import resolution

**2. React-Konva Mock Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
```typescript
// Issue: Canvas elements not rendering in tests
expect(screen.getByTestId('konva-rect')).toBeInTheDocument();
// Error: Unable to find element - TestingLibraryElementError
```
- **Root Cause**: React-Konva components need proper jest mocking
- **Solution**: Enhanced mock implementation for Konva canvas rendering
- **Status**: Mock structure created, needs refinement

**3. TestUtils Module Integration (IN PROGRESS)**
```typescript
// Issue: testUtils import path resolution
import { createMockCanvasElement } from '@/tests/utils/testUtils';
// Error: Cannot find module '@/tests/utils/testUtils'
```
- **Root Cause**: Jest module resolution with .tsx extension
- **Solution**: Proper extension handling in Jest configuration
- **Status**: Working on module resolution patterns

## 📋 **Comprehensive Testing Best Practices & Guidelines**

### **🎯 Testing Architecture & Configuration**

#### **✅ DO'S - Jest Configuration & Setup**

- **Configure Jest for ESM properly** by setting `transform: {}` in your Jest config to disable transforms and use `node --experimental-vm-modules` when running tests
- **Set `"type": "module"` in package.json** and update your test script to `"test": "node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/.bin/jest"`
- **Create a proper jest.setup.js file** that initializes canvas mocking and any global test configurations
- **Use jest-canvas-mock** to properly mock canvas operations and HTML5 Canvas API calls
- **Configure extensionsToTreatAsEsm** for TypeScript files when necessary

#### **❌ DON'TS - Jest Configuration & Setup**

- **Don't rely on automatic Jest configuration** - ESM support is still experimental and requires explicit setup
- **Don't mix CommonJS and ESM** patterns in your test files - be consistent with module syntax
- **Don't skip the experimental VM modules flag** - Jest needs this for proper ESM support
- **Don't use outdated Jest ESM tutorials** - the configuration has changed significantly between versions

### **🔧 Module Mocking & Imports**

#### **✅ DO'S - Module Mocking**

- **Use `jest.unstable_mockModule()` for ESM modules** instead of `jest.mock()` for proper ESM mocking
- **Import modules dynamically after mocking** using `await import()` to ensure mocks are applied correctly
- **Create centralized mock files** in `__mocks__` directories for commonly used dependencies like Tauri APIs
- **Mock the Tauri bridge properly** by creating comprehensive mocks for `@tauri-apps/api` that simulate `invoke` and `listen` functionality
- **Use `createRequire` when mocking CommonJS modules** from ESM test files

#### **❌ DON'TS - Module Mocking**

- **Don't expect automatic hoisting** with ESM - you must manually control import order after mocking
- **Don't mock everything indiscriminately** - only mock external dependencies and leave internal logic unmocked for better test coverage
- **Don't forget to provide factory functions** for `jest.unstable_mockModule` - they're mandatory unlike `jest.mock`
- **Don't reuse the same dynamic import** after unmocking - create fresh imports to avoid stale references

### **🗃️ Zustand Store Testing**

#### **✅ DO'S - Store Testing**

- **Use React Testing Library's `renderHook`** to test store hooks in isolation
- **Reset store state between tests** using `afterEach` hooks to ensure test isolation
- **Test store behavior, not implementation** by verifying state changes through actions rather than internal variables
- **Create test-specific store instances** when needed to avoid state pollution between tests
- **Use `act()` wrapper** when testing store updates that trigger React re-renders

#### **❌ DON'TS - Store Testing**

- **Don't test internal store implementation details** - focus on the public API and state changes
- **Don't forget to clean up store state** between tests - this can cause flaky test results
- **Don't mock Zustand unnecessarily** - test against real store instances when possible
- **Don't skip testing store slices** - test individual slices and their interactions

### **🎨 React Konva Canvas Testing**

#### **✅ DO'S - Canvas Testing**

- **Test canvas behavior through user interactions** rather than internal Konva API calls
- **Use proper canvas mocking libraries** like jest-canvas-mock to simulate drawing operations
- **Test component rendering** by verifying that Stage and Layer components mount correctly
- **Simulate mouse and touch events** using Testing Library's fireEvent on canvas elements
- **Test transformation operations** like drag, scale, and rotate through simulated user gestures
- **Verify canvas export functionality** by testing `stage.toDataURL()` and `stage.toJSON()` methods

#### **❌ DON'TS - Canvas Testing**

- **Don't test Konva internals directly** - focus on component behavior and user interactions
- **Don't skip performance testing** for complex canvas operations with many shapes
- **Don't ignore touch events** - mobile interactions are crucial for canvas applications
- **Don't forget to test edge cases** like empty canvases, invalid inputs, or extreme zoom levels

### **🔧 Tauri-Specific Testing**

#### **✅ DO'S - Tauri Testing**

- **Mock Tauri commands comprehensively** by creating realistic responses for all `invoke` calls
- **Test error scenarios** for Tauri command failures and network issues
- **Use proper async/await patterns** when testing Tauri commands that return promises
- **Test event listeners** for backend events using mocked event emitters
- **Verify loading states** during Tauri command execution

#### **❌ DON'TS - Tauri Testing**

- **Don't test against real Tauri commands** in unit tests - always use mocks
- **Don't forget to test command parameter validation** - ensure proper data is sent to the backend
- **Don't skip testing the bridge failure cases** - network issues and command errors should be handled gracefully
- **Don't ignore event cleanup** - test that event listeners are properly removed

### **📊 Performance & Stress Testing**

#### **✅ DO'S - Performance Testing**

- **Test with realistic data volumes** - simulate scenarios with hundreds or thousands of canvas elements
- **Measure rendering performance** using performance timing APIs in your tests
- **Test memory usage** to ensure no memory leaks during intensive operations
- **Verify frame rates** for animations and interactive elements
- **Test on different device profiles** when possible to ensure broad compatibility

#### **❌ DON'TS - Performance Testing**

- **Don't skip stress testing** - canvas applications can become slow with complex scenes
- **Don't ignore memory cleanup** - failing to test cleanup can lead to memory leaks
- **Don't assume performance** - always verify that optimizations actually work
- **Don't test performance in isolation** - consider the full application context

### **🏗️ Test Structure & Organization**

#### **✅ DO'S - Test Structure**

- **Keep tests small and focused** - each test should verify a single behavior or feature
- **Use descriptive test names** that clearly explain what functionality is being tested
- **Group related tests** using `describe` blocks to organize test suites logically
- **Test edge cases and error conditions** to ensure robust error handling
- **Use proper setup and teardown** with `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for test isolation

#### **❌ DON'TS - Test Structure**

- **Don't write tests that depend on other tests** - maintain test independence
- **Don't test private methods or internal implementation** - focus on public interfaces
- **Don't use `try...catch` blocks in tests** - let Jest handle assertion failures properly
- **Don't create overly complex test scenarios** - break them into smaller, focused tests

### **🚨 Error Handling & Debugging**

#### **✅ DO'S - Error Handling**

- **Test error boundaries** in React components to ensure graceful failure handling
- **Verify error messages** are meaningful and helpful for debugging
- **Test recovery scenarios** where the application can recover from errors
- **Use proper assertion methods** that provide clear failure messages
- **Test async error handling** with proper promise rejection testing

#### **❌ DON'TS - Error Handling**

- **Don't suppress test errors** - let them bubble up for proper debugging
- **Don't write tests that can pass accidentally** - ensure tests fail when they should
- **Don't ignore TypeScript errors** in test files - maintain type safety
- **Don't skip testing error paths** - they're often the most critical scenarios

### **🔄 Test Maintenance & Best Practices**

#### **✅ DO'S - Maintenance**

- **Follow the test pyramid** - write more unit tests than integration tests, more integration than E2E
- **Use behavioral testing approaches** - test what the code does, not how it does it
- **Implement proper CI/CD integration** to run tests automatically on code changes
- **Maintain consistent test patterns** across your codebase for easier maintenance
- **Document complex test scenarios** with clear comments explaining the testing approach

#### **❌ DON'TS - Maintenance**

- **Don't let test coverage become the only metric** - focus on meaningful test quality over quantity
- **Don't ignore failing tests** - fix or remove them immediately to maintain test suite integrity
- **Don't duplicate test logic** - create reusable test utilities for common patterns
- **Don't test external library functionality** - focus on your application logic
- **Don't write tests just for coverage** - ensure each test serves a real purpose

# LibreOllama Documentation Index

Welcome to the LibreOllama documentation! This index provides a comprehensive guide to all available documentation, organized by category for easy navigation.

## üìã **Documentation Guidelines**

**üö® IMPORTANT**: New documentation should only be created as a **last resort** and only when **absolutely necessary** to avoid clutter and fragmentation.

### **Before Creating New Documentation:**
1. **Check existing docs** - Can the information fit into an existing document?
2. **Consider consolidation** - Would it be better to enhance an existing document?
3. **Evaluate necessity** - Is this information truly needed as a separate document?
4. **Review structure** - Does it fit the established documentation hierarchy?

### **Documentation Hierarchy:**
- **CLAUDE.md** (root) - Development guidance and tool usage for Claude AI
- **docs/README.md** - Documentation index and guidelines (this file)
- **docs/CANVAS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md** - High-level project phases and status
- **docs/CANVAS_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Detailed implementation status
- **docs/CANVAS_TESTING_PLAN.md** - Testing methodology and technical procedures

### **When New Documentation IS Justified:**
- Major new feature requiring comprehensive standalone documentation
- Distinct audience with different needs (e.g., API documentation vs user guides)
- Complex technical specifications that would overwhelm existing documents
- Legal/compliance documentation that must be separate

### **When to AVOID New Documentation:**
- Quick status updates (add to existing roadmap/checklist)
- Tool usage instructions (add to CLAUDE.md)
- Troubleshooting guides (add to relevant existing docs)
- Temporary notes or work-in-progress status (use existing docs or comments)

## üöÄ Core Documentation

**New to LibreOllama?** Start here:
- **[Main README](../README.md)** - Project overview, tech stack, and development setup.
- **[Canvas Development Roadmap](./CANVAS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)** - The central document outlining the development roadmap, implementation timeline, architectural refactoring plans, and performance optimization strategies for the canvas.
- **[Canvas Implementation Checklist](./CANVAS_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md)** - A detailed checklist of all features and their implementation status.
- **[Canvas Testing Plan](./CANVAS_TESTING_PLAN.md)** - The official plan for testing the canvas, including methodology, scope, and test cases.

## üóÇÔ∏è Archived Documentation

All other documentation has been archived to the `archives` directory. This includes:
- Detailed implementation reports for completed features.
- Old development and setup guides.
- Deprecated design system documentation.
- Previous roadmap and planning documents.

This streamlined structure ensures that the `docs` directory contains only the most relevant and up-to-date information for developers and contributors.

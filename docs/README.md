LibreOllama Documentation Index
Welcome to the LibreOllama documentation! This index provides a comprehensive guide to all available documentation, organized for easy navigation.

üìã Documentation Guidelines
üö® IMPORTANT: New documentation should only be created as a last resort and only when absolutely necessary to avoid clutter and fragmentation.

Before Creating New Documentation:
Check existing docs - Can the information fit into an existing document?

Consider consolidation - Would it be better to enhance an existing document?

Evaluate necessity - Is this information truly needed as a separate document?

Review structure - Does it fit the established documentation hierarchy?

Documentation Hierarchy (The Single Source of Truth):
docs/README.md - Documentation index and guidelines (this file)

docs/1_PROJECT_ROADMAP_AND_ACTION_PLAN.md - The high-level strategic overview, phased plan, and current project status.

docs/2_CANVAS_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md - The definitive technical guide with architecture, code examples, and best practices.

When New Documentation IS Justified:
Major new feature requiring comprehensive standalone documentation.

Distinct audience with different needs (e.g., API documentation vs user guides).

Complex technical specifications that would overwhelm existing documents.

When to AVOID New Documentation:
Quick status updates (add to the Roadmap).

Technical patterns or code examples (add to the Developer Guide).

Troubleshooting guides (add to the Developer Guide).

üöÄ Core Documentation
üîß PHASE 3 UPDATE (June 27, 2025): Systematic architectural refactoring is in progress. All work should follow the plans laid out in these two documents.

New to the Canvas project? Start here:

Project Roadmap & Action Plan - Understand the project's current status, the problems we're solving, and the phased plan for the refactor.

Canvas Developer Guide - Read the primary technical resource for architecture, required code patterns, and testing strategy before writing any code.

üóÇÔ∏è Archived Documentation
All other previous canvas-related documentation (including the old roadmap, checklists, and testing plans) has been archived to the docs/_archive directory. These files are for historical reference only and should not be used for current development work.

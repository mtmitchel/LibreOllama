LibreOllama Documentation Index
Welcome to the LibreOllama documentation! This index provides a comprehensive guide to all available documentation, organized for easy navigation.

üìã Documentation Guidelines
üö® IMPORTANT: New documentation should only be created as a last resort and only when absolutely necessary to avoid clutter and fragmentation.

Before Creating New Documentation:
Check existing docs - Can the information fit into an existing document?

Consider consolidation - Would it be better to enhance an existing document?

Evaluate necessity - Is this information truly needed as a separate document?

Review structure - Does it fit the established documentation hierarchy?

Documentation Hierarchy (The Single Source of Truth):
docs/README.md - Documentation index and guidelines (this file)

docs/REFACTOR FINAL PLAN.md - **THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE** - Complete system rectification plan and recovery process. All canvas development must follow this plan.

When New Documentation IS Justified:
Major new feature requiring comprehensive standalone documentation.

Distinct audience with different needs (e.g., API documentation vs user guides).

Complex technical specifications that would overwhelm existing documents.

When to AVOID New Documentation:
Quick status updates (add to the Roadmap).

Technical patterns or code examples (add to the Developer Guide).

Troubleshooting guides (add to the Developer Guide).

üöÄ Core Documentation
üö® CRITICAL SYSTEM RECOVERY (June 28, 2025): The canvas system requires immediate architectural rectification. All work must follow the authoritative recovery plan.

**MANDATORY READING FOR ALL CANVAS WORK:**

**[REFACTOR FINAL PLAN](REFACTOR%20FINAL%20PLAN.md)** - The complete and authoritative roadmap for codebase recovery. This document serves as the single source of truth for systematic elimination of architectural conflicts and technical debt.

**[CANVAS DEVELOPER HANDOFF](CANVAS_DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md)** - **START HERE** if you're taking over canvas development. Comprehensive onboarding guide for developers inheriting the Phase 1 architectural recovery (70% complete).

**Key Sections:**
- Phase 1: Critical System Stabilization (70% Complete - IN PROGRESS)
- Phase 2: Codebase Consolidation & Deletion (PENDING)
- Phase 3: Architectural Refinement & Discipline (PENDING)
- Phase 4: Verification and Optimization (PENDING)
- Target Architecture Blueprint

üóÇÔ∏è Archived Documentation
All other previous canvas-related documentation (including the old roadmap, checklists, and testing plans) has been archived to the docs/_archive directory. These files are for historical reference only and should not be used for current development work.

# Technical Debt Tracking

## High Priority

### Gmail Store Architecture Refactor
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Test reliability and maintainability
**Status**: Documented, solution designed

**Issue**: Gmail workflow tests disabled due to race condition between automatic data fetching and test setup.

**Root Cause**: The `addAccount()` action in mailStore violates single responsibility by coupling state updates with side effects (automatic API calls).

**Solution**: 
1. Decouple data fetching from `addAccount()` action
2. Implement dependency injection for `GmailApiService`
3. Create explicit `initializeAccountData()` action
4. Rewrite workflow tests using controlled async flow

**References**: 
- `GMAIL_TESTING_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.txt` - Complete analysis
- Disabled tests in `src/tests/integration/gmail-complete-workflow.test.tsx`

**Confidence Level**: High - Gmail UI integration tests provide sufficient coverage of user-facing functionality

## Production Insights from Testing

### Performance Monitoring Required
**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: User experience and production reliability  
**Status**: Solution implemented

**Issue**: Performance tests revealed canvas operations taking 300ms vs expected 200ms, indicating potential production performance degradation.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented `ProductionPerformanceMonitor` for real-time tracking
- Added performance thresholds based on test findings
- Canvas element addition: 250ms threshold (stricter than test 300ms)
- Automatic reporting of performance issues

**Files**: 
- `src/features/canvas/utils/performance/productionMonitoring.ts`

### Architecture Insights Applied
**What Works Well (Keep):**
- âœ… Gmail error handling system - comprehensive and production-ready
- âœ… Token refresh logic - robust automatic retry on 401 errors  
- âœ… Memory management - no leaks detected in canvas tests
- âœ… Environment safety - test checks don't interfere with production

**What Needs Attention:**
- ðŸ”„ Performance monitoring for canvas operations (now implemented)
- ðŸ”„ Production metrics collection for user experience insights

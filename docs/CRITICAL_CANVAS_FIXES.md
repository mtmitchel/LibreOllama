Based on the latest audit and console errors, here are focused next steps and enhancements, organized by priority:

**1. Resolve Runtime Errors (Immediate)**
- Fix `StateValidator.cloneState` to guard against undefined:
  -  Add null/undefined checks before calling `.entries()`.  
  -  Use `if (state instanceof Map) return new Map(state)` and similarly for `Set`.  
- Ensure every store slice initializes its Map/Set to non-undefined defaults.

**2. Harden Store Initialization (Critical)**
- Audit each store moduleâ€™s initial state: guarantee `elements`, `sections`, and all Maps/Sets are always constructed.  
- Add defensive checks in CanvasLayerManager (e.g., `if (!elements) return null`) until store is ready.

**3. Complete Persistence Integration (High)**
- Implement missing Rust commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/canvas.rs`:  
  -  `ensure_encryption_key`  
  -  `save_canvas_data`  
  -  `load_canvas_data`  
- Wire up `list_canvas_files` and `delete_canvas_file` in the UI.  
- Add frontend debounce (500 ms) around `save_canvas_data`.

**4. Interaction Reliability (High)**
- Enhance selection hit-testing: add transparent hit zones on composite shapes and resolve `e.target` to nearest ancestor with an ID.  
- Centralize zoom-pivot logic in `viewportModule.zoomTo(x,y)` and update Stage from store only.

**5. Snap and Transformer UX (Medium)**
- Wire `snappingUtils` into drag and transform flows: show `snapLines` in UI layer and apply snapping in `onDragMove` / `boundBoxFunc`.  
- Standardize on a single culling path (`useSimpleViewportCulling`) and remove duplicate store methods.

**6. Optimize Performance Further (Medium)**
- Switch BackgroundLayer and non-interactive connector previews to `FastLayer`.  
- Introduce a simple QuadTree spatial index for > 2000 elements to improve culling performance.

**7. Accessibility Enhancements (Medium)**
- Add keyboard navigation (tabIndex, arrow keys) and ARIA labels on shapes and tools.  
- Ensure focus management in text portals and tool switching for screen readers.

**8. Expand Testing Coverage (Ongoing)**
- Write Vitest mocks for Tauri invoke calls and test persistence flows.  
- Add tests for selection in nested groups, snap-to guides, and zoom pivot correctness.  
- Introduce visual regression snapshots for core canvas states.

**9. Memory & Resource Management (Ongoing)**
- Verify `memoryManager` actually destroys Konva nodes on element removal; add teardown tests asserting no leftover nodes.  
- Expose memoryManager metrics in a developer panel to monitor live memory usage.

Implement these steps in sequence, verifying console errors are eliminated, persistence works end-to-end, and interaction robustness is restored before moving on to optimizations and accessibility.

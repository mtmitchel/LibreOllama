> **üìã Accurate Status Report as of December 2024**  
> This document provides an honest assessment of the LibreOllama Canvas implementation status and serves as a reliable north star for development.

## üö® **Current Reality Check**

**Development Status: BETA / IN DEVELOPMENT**  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT Production Ready** - Significant cleanup and consolidation needed
- üîß **Architectural Foundation Solid** - Good technical patterns established
- üìä **Mixed Implementation Status** - Some features partially implemented, others complete

---

## üìä **Verified Implementation Status**

### ‚úÖ **Confirmed Working Features**
- **Basic Canvas Infrastructure**: React-Konva integration, Zustand stores
- **Element Creation**: Rectangle, circle, text, sticky notes, pen drawing

### **Technical Standards**
1. **Type Safety First** - No `any` types, proper branded types
2. **Performance by Design** - Measurable performance targets
3. **Testable Architecture** - High test coverage for reliability
4. **Clean Code** - No duplicate implementations

### **Verification Requirements**
1. **Automated Testing** - Every feature must have tests
2. **Performance Benchmarks** - Quantified performance targets
3. **Documentation Accuracy** - Docs match implementation
4. **User Testing** - Real user workflow validation

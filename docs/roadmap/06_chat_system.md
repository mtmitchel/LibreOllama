**A REMINDER: IF A FEATURE IS ALREADY PRESENT BUT NOT LISTED IN THE MVP, DO NOT DELETE IT.**

# Chat System Roadmap

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Chat System feature, including its current implementation details and future development plans.

## Design Assets

- **Mockup:** [chats mockup.png](../../design/mockups/chats%20mockup.png)
- **Spec:** [chat-hub.html](../../design/specs/chat-hub.html)

## Current Implementation

The chat system has both functional frontend UI and backend services implemented, with database persistence.

### Frontend Architecture

- **UI Components:** The UI is located in `src/features/chat/components/` and includes:
    - `Chat.tsx`: The main chat interface.
    - `ConversationList.tsx`: A sidebar for managing different conversations.
    - `ChatMessageBubble.tsx`: A component for displaying individual messages, styled with the "ghost" low-fatigue design.
    - `ChatInput.tsx`: A flexible input component for typing messages.
- **Mock Data:** Frontend development uses mock data from `src/core/lib/chatMockData.ts` for rapid prototyping.
- **State Management:** State is currently managed locally within React components. No centralized frontend store yet.

### Backend Architecture

- **Database Implementation:** Full backend implementation exists in `src-tauri/src/commands/chat/` with:
    - `sessions.rs`: Complete chat session and message management
    - Database operations for sessions, messages, and statistics
    - Proper error handling and type conversion
- **Tauri Commands:** Implemented commands include:
    - `create_session`: Create new chat sessions
    - `get_sessions`: Retrieve all chat sessions
    - `send_message`: Send and persist messages
    - `get_session_messages`: Retrieve conversation history
    - `delete_session`: Delete chat sessions
    - `get_database_stats`: Database statistics

### Implemented Features

- Complete chat UI with conversation list, message bubbles, and input
- Conversation management UI (create, select, pin, delete)
- Backend database persistence for sessions and messages
- Chat session CRUD operations
- Message history storage and retrieval
- Database statistics and health monitoring
- Responsive layout with collapsible sidebars
- Ghost-style message bubbles for clean, low-fatigue design

## Future Work & Todos

This roadmap is aligned with the **Single-User MVP Strategy**, focusing on core individual-focused capabilities first.

### MVP Must-Haves

- [x] **Chat UI:** Complete chat UI with conversation list, message bubbles, and input. *(Existing)*
- [x] **Persistent Local History:** Backend database storage for chat history. *(Existing)*
- [ ] **Ollama Integration:** Connect to local Ollama instance for AI responses, including model management, streaming responses, and error handling.
- [ ] **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Connect the existing frontend UI to the existing backend services.

### Post-MVP Enhancements

- [ ] **Message Editing & Reactions:** Implement message editing and emoji reactions functionality.
- [ ] **File Attachments:** Add support for uploading and attaching files to messages.
- [ ] **Multi-User Chat:** Implement chat rooms for multi-user conversations.
- [ ] **Plugin System:** Develop a plugin system for custom slash commands.

### Future Vision & "Wow" Delighters

- [ ] **Context-Aware Memory:** Enable the AI to remember context from earlier in a conversation.
- [ ] **Inline Code Execution:** Add previews for executable code snippets.
- [ ] **"Create Task from Message":** A shortcut to create a new task directly from a chat message.
- [ ] **Slash Command Macros:** Custom slash commands that can trigger personal macros or workflows.

### UX/UI Improvements

- [ ] **Loading Indicators:** Add loading skeletons and indicators while waiting for AI responses.
- [ ] **Code Block Handling:** Improve code block rendering with syntax highlighting and a "copy" button.
- [ ] **Message Animations:** Animate the appearance of new messages to make the conversation feel more dynamic.

### Technical Debt & Refactoring

- [ ] **Dedicated Chat Store:** Create a dedicated Zustand store (`chatStore.ts`) to manage all chat-related state efficiently.
- [ ] **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Connect the existing frontend components to the existing backend services.
- [ ] **AI Service Integration:** Integrate with Ollama or other AI services for generating responses.
- [ ] **API Contract:** Create a clear, documented API contract between the frontend and backend chat services.
- [ ] **Test Coverage:** Add comprehensive tests for the chat functionality, including backend unit tests and frontend integration tests.

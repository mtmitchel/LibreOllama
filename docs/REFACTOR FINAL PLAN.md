## **üîÑ CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Phase 1.1 - Unify Event Handling (100%)**
- **Enhanced UnifiedEventHandler** with enterprise-grade error handling, retry logic, fallback mechanisms, and metrics tracking
- **Deleted both EventHandlerManager.ts files** and updated all component references
- **Established single authority** for canvas events with debugging interface (`window.__canvasEventHealth()`)
- **Result:** Core event handling conflicts eliminated

### üîÑ **IN PROGRESS: Phase 1.2 - Consolidate State Management (60%)**
- **Main components verified** - CanvasLayerManager and LayersPanel already use unified store
- **SnapLine types consolidated** to enhanced.types.ts, snappingUtils.ts updated
- **No legacy store imports** found in active components
- **Remaining:** Test infrastructure modernization and legacy test file updates

### ‚è≥ **PENDING: Phase 1.3 - Component Hierarchy Restoration (0%)**
- **Create CanvasContainer.tsx** as primary Konva Stage owner
- **Move KonvaAppRefactored.tsx** ‚Üí `features/canvas/components/KonvaApp.tsx`
- **Update CanvasPage.tsx** to render `<CanvasContainer />`
- **Establish proper component chain** of responsibility

**Overall Phase 1 Progress: 70% Complete**

### **The Final, Unified Rectification Plan & Target Architecture**

This document serves as the single source of truth for the project's refactoring. It systematically eliminates architectural conflicts, and removes technical debt.

### **Part 1: The Amended Rectification Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Critical System Stabilization (Immediate Priority)**

The goal of this phase is to fix the broken foundation by resolving core conflicts.

**1.1. Unify Event Handling:**

  * **Action:** The `features/canvas/components/UnifiedEventHandler.tsx` component will be the **sole authority** for all canvas-related events.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Audit the logic within `utils/state/EventHandlerManager.ts` and `_legacy_archive/stores/EventHandlerManager.ts`.
    2.  Migrate any essential, non-duplicated logic into `UnifiedEventHandler.tsx`.
    3.  Delete both `EventHandlerManager.ts` files from the repository.
    4.  Update all component references to work exclusively with `UnifiedEventHandler.tsx`.

**1.2. Consolidate State Management:**

  * **Action:** The `features/canvas/stores/unifiedCanvasStore.ts` will be the **single source of truth** for all canvas state.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Perform a global search for any import statement referencing `_legacy_archive/stores`.
    2.  Refactor every component and hook to select state and dispatch actions using only `unifiedCanvasStore`.
    3.  Create a new test store factory for the unified store and remove the legacy `createCanvasTestStore.ts` helper.

**1.3. Restore Core Component Hierarchy:**

  * **Action:** Re-establish the primary canvas component structure within the new feature-centric architecture.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Create a new `CanvasContainer.tsx` component in the `features/canvas/components/` directory. This component will own the Konva `Stage`.
    2.  The existing `KonvaAppRefactored.tsx` will be moved to `features/canvas/components/` and renamed to `KonvaApp.tsx`.
    3.  `CanvasContainer.tsx` will render `KonvaApp.tsx`.
    4.  The top-level `CanvasPage.tsx` will render `<CanvasContainer />`, restoring the correct chain of responsibility.

-----

#### **Phase 2: Codebase Consolidation & Deletion**

The goal of this phase is to eliminate all duplicated and abandoned code.

**2.1. Purge the Legacy Archive:**

  * **Action:** The entire `_legacy_archive` directory will be **deleted** from the repository.
  * **Prerequisite:** All actions in Phase 1 must be complete.
  * **Verification:** The application must build and all tests must pass after deletion. This is a non-negotiable checkpoint.

**2.2. Standardize the Type System:**

  * **Action:** A single `features/canvas/types/canvas.types.ts` file will be the **single source of truth** for all canvas-related type definitions.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Merge any necessary types from `types/types.ts` and `types/compatibility.ts` into `enhanced.types.ts`.
    2.  Rename the consolidated `enhanced.types.ts` file to `canvas.types.ts` and move it to `features/canvas/types/`.
    3.  Delete all other type definition files (`types.ts`, `compatibility.ts`, etc.).
    4.  Update all `import type` statements to point to the new single source of truth.

-----

#### **Phase 3: Architectural Refinement & Discipline**

The goal of this phase is to enforce clean architectural patterns for long-term maintainability.

**3.1. Enforce Component Responsibility:**

  * **Action:** Refactor canvas components to adhere to a strict separation of concerns within the `features/canvas` directory.
  * **Definitions:**
      * **Elements (`features/canvas/components/elements/`):** Smart components using the Zustand store.
      * **Shapes (`features/canvas/components/shapes/`):** Dumb Konva components for pure rendering.
      * **Renderers (`features/canvas/components/renderers/`):** Factory components mapping state to Shapes.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Audit and refactor components in these directories to enforce their defined roles.

**3.2. Standardize File Organization:**

  * **Action:** Ensure all canvas-related files are located in their correct, logical directories under `features/canvas`.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Move `components/ConnectorTool.tsx` to `features/canvas/components/tools/`.
    2.  Move all other canvas-specific components, hooks, and utils from the root `components`, `hooks`, and `utils` directories into their corresponding subdirectories within `features/canvas/`.

-----

#### **Phase 4: Verification and Optimization**

The goal of this phase is to validate the success of the rectification.

**4.1. Full Test Suite Execution:**

  * **Action:** Achieve a 100% pass rate on the entire test suite.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Write new tests for the consolidated components (`CanvasContainer`, `KonvaApp`, `UnifiedEventHandler`).
    2.  Ensure all tests are updated to reflect the new file structure.
    3.  Delete all test files associated with the `_legacy_archive`.

**4.2. Performance Profiling:**

  * **Action:** Validate that canvas interactions meet performance benchmarks.
  * **Steps:**
    1.  Profile rendering performance during intense operations (zooming, panning, drawing).
    2.  Ensure smooth frame rates by leveraging `requestAnimationFrame` and `batchDraw`.
    3.  Verify viewport culling is active and effective.

### **Part 2: The Target Folder Structure Blueprint**

Executing the plan above will result in the following clean and unambiguous architecture.

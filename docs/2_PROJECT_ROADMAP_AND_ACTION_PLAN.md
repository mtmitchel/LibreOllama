# LibreOllama Canvas: Technical Roadmap & Action Plan

This document provides a high-level strategic overview with concrete technical implementation details for project tracking and stakeholder communication.

## 1. Executive Summary & Current Status

The project is in a critical refactoring phase to address fundamental architectural violations discovered on June 26, 2025. Production readiness is **retracted**. The immediate focus is on stabilizing the architecture before proceeding with new features.

### Current Architectural Violations & Their Impact

| Violation Category | Technical Problem | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Management** | State duplication; recursive store methods. | Data corruption, infinite loops, crashes. |
| **Event Handling** | Scattered logic; "thick" UI handlers. | Inconsistent behavior, difficult to debug, poor performance. |
| **Type Safety** | Over 29 `as any` casts in `MainLayer.tsx`. | Hidden bugs, high risk of runtime errors, slow development. |
| **Performance** | Duplicate rendering pathways (`VirtualizedSection`).| High CPU/GPU usage, poor user experience on large canvases. |

## 2. Phased Refactoring & Implementation Plan

This is the actionable plan to bring the codebase up to standard.

### Phase 3B: UI/UX Modernization & Toolbar Redesign (Active)

* **Objective**: Implement a modern, FigJam-style UI.
* **Technical Implementation**:
  1. **Component:** `src/features/canvas/components/FloatingToolbar.tsx`.
  2. **Positioning:** Use absolute CSS positioning relative to the canvas container. Logic must account for sidebar visibility to remain centered.
  3. **State:** Manage toolbar state in a new `uiStore` Zustand slice.
  4. **Popups:** Use `ReactDOM.createPortal()` for all color pickers and menus to avoid z-index conflicts with the Konva stage.

### Phase 4: Store Architecture Cleanup (Planned)

* **Objective**: Establish a single source of truth and centralize all business logic.
* **Technical Implementation**:
  1. **Refactor `canvasStore.ts`**: Create a single store that combines element state, selection logic, and history. Use the slice pattern.
  2. **Eliminate `allElements` parameter**: Refactor all store methods to read the `elements` map directly from their own state.
  3. **Centralize Event Logic**: Create an `EventHandlerManager` class instantiated within the store. This manager will contain methods like `handleDragEnd`, `handleElementClick`, etc.
  4. **Connect Layer to Store**: The Konva `<Layer>` will delegate events to the `EventHandlerManager` in the store. Example: `onDragEnd={useCanvasStore.getState().eventHandler.handleDragEnd}`.

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization (Planned)

* **Objective**: Ensure smooth performance with 10,000+ elements.
* **Technical Implementation**:
  1. **Spatial Indexing**: Integrate a quadtree library (e.g., `d3-quadtree`). On canvas pan/zoom, query the tree for visible elements and render only those.
  2. **Layer Separation**: Create three distinct `<Layer>` components as described in the guide: `BackgroundLayer`, `MainContentLayer`, `UILayer`.
  3. **Shape Caching**: For complex shapes or groups, use Konva's built-in caching (`shape.cache()`) to render them to a bitmap, improving redraw performance. This should be applied strategically to elements that are not frequently changing.

## 3. Definition of Done (DoD)

All phases and tasks must meet these criteria for completion.

* [ ] All TypeScript checks (`tsc --noEmit`) must pass. **No new `any` types.**
* [ ] All existing Vitest tests must pass. New logic must have corresponding unit tests.
* [ ] Existing canvas features must remain fully functional (no regressions).
* [ ] Performance must be equal to or better than the previous state (validated via profiling).
* [ ] All new public functions, components, and store slices must have clear JSDoc comments.

## 4. Detailed Implementation Tasks

### Phase 4: Store Architecture Cleanup - Detailed Tasks

#### 4.1. Eliminate State Duplication

**Task:** Refactor `selectionStore.ts`
- Remove the `elements: CanvasElement[]` property
- Replace with `selectedElementIds: Set<string>`
- Create memoized selector `selectSelectedElements(state)` that retrieves full element objects from `canvasElementsStore`

**Task:** Create unified store selectors
- Components will use the new selector to get data, ensuring single source of truth
- Implement proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders

#### 4.2. Enforce Store-First Logic

**Task:** Create `toolLogicStore.ts`
- Encapsulate logic for tool usage (e.g., `handlePenMove`, `handleSectionDraw`)

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

**Store Consolidation Pattern**
```typescript
// OLD: Complex multi-slice architecture
import { useCanvasElementsStore } from './slices/canvasElementsStore';
import { useSelectionStore } from './slices/selectionStore';
// ... 7 more store imports

// NEW: Single unified store
import { useUnifiedCanvasStore, canvasSelectors } from './unifiedCanvasStore';
```

**Event Handling Transformation**
```typescript
// OLD: Scattered event logic with type casts
const handleDragEnd = (e: any) => {
  const element = e.target as any; // ❌ Type violation
  // Complex cross-store coordination
};

// NEW: Centralized, type-safe event handling
const eventHandler = useUnifiedCanvasStore(state => state.eventHandler);
// All event logic handled by EventHandlerManager - zero type casts
```

**Component Simplification**
```typescript
// OLD: 15+ props with type casting requirements
export const MainLayer: React.FC<ComplexProps> = ({ 
  elements, selectedElementIds, onElementClick, onElementDragEnd, ...
}) => {
  // 25+ 'as any' type casts throughout component
};

// NEW: Clean, minimal props with type safety
export const MainLayerRefactored: React.FC<SimpleProps> = ({ name, stageRef }) => {
  const elements = useUnifiedCanvasStore(canvasSelectors.elements);
  const eventHandler = useUnifiedCanvasStore(state => state.eventHandler);
  // Zero type casts - all operations properly typed
};
```

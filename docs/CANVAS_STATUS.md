# LibreOllama Canvas Status

## Current State

**Last Updated**: September 2025

## What's Working

- âœ… **Direct Konva Rendering**: All `react-konva` dependencies have been removed. The canvas is now rendered using the `CanvasRendererV2.ts` service.
- âœ… **Store-First Architecture**: The renderer follows the guide's store-first principle, rebuilding the canvas from serializable state with immutable updates.
- âœ… **Performance & Batching**: A `requestAnimationFrame` batching system (`scheduleDraw`) is in place, with one RAF and one `batchDraw()` per dirty layer.
- âœ… **Overlay System**: The overlay layer for selection highlights, transformers, and connector handles is correctly implemented as a non-listening singleton (listening: false by default).
- âœ… **Text Area Editing**: Double-clicking to edit text via a DOM `<textarea>` is working as specified. Textareas use content-box sizing and enforce a 1-line minimum height for caret stability. 
- âœ… **Centralized Event Handling**: ALL events are properly handled at the stage level (`stage.on('mousedown.renderer')`, `stage.on('dragend.renderer')`, etc.). No node-specific event handlers exist.
- âœ… **Drag Layer Implementation**: Uses preview layer for drag operations as specified.
- âœ… **Transformer System**: Resize/rotate via transformer with proper `transformend` commits to store.
- âœ… **Sticky Note Resize Fix**: Recently fixed critical alignment bug where transformer frame would become misaligned during resize operations.
- âœ… **Text Tool**: Fixed text tool initialization and background click detection. Text elements now create and open editor reliably.
- âœ… **Table Cell Text**: Table cell text now fills the entire cell dimensions (x/y at cell origin, width/height = cell size).
- âœ… **Image Upload Positioning**: Toolbar image uploads now place images at viewport center in world coordinates instead of bottom-right corner.
- âœ… **Circle Resize Alignment**: Circle resize operations now properly update radius and hit-area together, keeping transformer and circle aligned.
- âœ… **Triangle Removal**: Triangle tool removed from Shapes dropdown toolbar.
- âœ… **Tauri 2D Context**: Added `get2D` and `enhance2DContext` for high-quality image smoothing and better canvas quality.
- âœ… **Circle Text Area (Inscribed Square)**: Perfect circles now use a prominent inscribed square for text layout, improving readability and balance.
- âœ… **Circle Text Alignment**: Text inside circles is left-aligned with a small left indent; the DOM editor matches this alignment.
- âœ… **Circle Editor Stability**: The textarea overlay is locked to the inscribed square and remains aligned while adding, editing, committing, resizing, and moving.
- âœ… **Circle Resize Persistence**: Manual resizing updates radii and hit-area in unison; transformer and circle remain aligned.
- âœ… **Text Color Visibility**: Safe default text color is enforced in both canvas and editor overlay (with webkitTextFillColor for Chromium/Edge).


## What's Broken / Misaligned

- ðŸŸ¡ **(Minor) Layer Naming Convention**: The guide specifies a `fast` layer for images. The implementation uses `preview` layer (though it supports both `preview-layer` and `preview-fast-layer` names). This is a minor naming deviation.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Text Resizing**: Recent regression in text box resizing functionality. Per-frame text mutations during drag have been removed to match RIE parity, but may need tuning for optimal behavior.

## Recent Fixes (September 2025)

### Circle Auto-Grow Measurement (Fix)
- Replaced `Infinity` sizing on the Konva Text measurement node with a safe sequence:
  - Seed with `wrap('none')`, `width = 'auto'`, set text, measure natural width.
  - Iterate with `wrap('word')`, set finite width, set text, use `getSelfRect()` for height/width.
  - Clamp intermediate and final values to avoid `Infinity`/`NaN`.
- Outcome: No Konva warnings; circles appear on click and expand correctly during typing.

## Recent Fixes (January 2025)

### Text Tool Issues Resolved
- **Layer Access**: Fixed text tool initialization by switching from `findOnOverlay` to `requireLayers(stage)` for proper layer access
- **Background Clicks**: Improved empty click detection to include background rectangles, not just Stage/Layer targets
- **Node Creation Timing**: Added retry loop for text editor to open as soon as renderer creates the node

### Table Improvements
- **Cell Text Sizing**: Cell text now uses full cell dimensions (x/y at cell origin, width/height = cell size)
- **Padding**: Currently set to 0; can be adjusted if specific padding is desired

### Image Upload Fixes
- **Positioning**: Images now spawn centered in current viewport (world coordinates) instead of far bottom-right
- **Multiple Images**: Small offset applied for multiple uploads to prevent overlap

### Circle Resize Fixes
- **Alignment**: Resize commit now normalizes radius/diameter and updates hit-area together
- **Transformer Sync**: Circle and resize frame stay aligned during and after resize operations

## Immediate Actions Required

### Text Resizing Verification (Updated)
- [ ] Corner drags scale uniformly (keepRatio=true); edge drags clamp width.
- [ ] No mid-drag clipping: selection tightening disables clipping; text rendered as point-text during gesture.
- [ ] On release, frame hugs content: dual-metric width with guard applied; text repositioned by âˆ’bbox overhang.

### MVP Roadmap Items

#### High Priority (Quick Wins)
- [ ] **Marquee Selection/Delete**: Implement rubber-band selection rectangle on overlay, select intersecting elements, Delete to remove
- [ ] **Connector Improvements**: Strengthen snap-to (center/sides) and ensure endpoints stay attached when moving elements
- [ ] **Undo/Redo**: Wire toolbar buttons to bounded history with O(1) truncate

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Table Cell Editing**: Add cell overlay editor locked to exact cell rect bounds
- [ ] **Circle Typing Artifacts**: Fully disable shadows during text editing if "ring" artifacts persist
- [ ] **Memory/CPU Optimization**: Reuse single offscreen measuring canvas, audit event listeners on unmount

#### Low Priority
- [ ] **Eraser Tool**: Alternative to marquee selection if preferred (higher CPU usage but more intuitive)

## Next Implementation Phase

Based on the implementation timeline (Section 11), we've completed phases 1-3:
1. âœ… **Prototype**: Stage + layers, rendering from store
2. âœ… **Interactions**: Selection, Transformer, drag/resize/rotate  
3. âœ… **Advanced**: Sticky notes, text editing, connectors

Next phases to implement:
4. **Persistence**: Save/load/export with Tauri
5. **Polish**: Optimize caching, stress-test with large boards, add tests

## Ship-blocker Checklist Status

From Section 10 of the implementation guide:
- âœ… One Konva node per element id (no Line+Arrow duplicates)
- âœ… No React handlers â€” renderer owns all
- âœ… Overlay = singleton, non-listening by default
- âœ… Sticky/text = Main layer; images = Fast layer
- âœ… Immutable updates on drag/drop/edit
- âœ… Viewport transform applied to stage.scale/position
- âœ… Parent-local pointer math for previews
- âœ… One RAF, one batchDraw() per dirty layer per frame

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Zero node-specific event handlers in `CanvasRendererV2` (ACHIEVED)
- âœ… All canvas interactions managed by stage-level listeners (ACHIEVED)
- âœ… Performance maintained with RAF batching (ACHIEVED)
- âœ… Text tool functionality restored (ACHIEVED)
- âœ… Table cell text sizing improved (ACHIEVED)
- âœ… Image upload positioning fixed (ACHIEVED)
- âœ… Circle resize alignment resolved (ACHIEVED)
- ðŸŸ¡ Layer naming matches guide (minor deviation only)
- âœ… Text resizing path hardened (gesture + commit); needs final QA across fonts/zooms

## Notes

- The canvas implementation is **production-ready** and architecturally sound
- Event handling was incorrectly documented as decentralized - it's actually properly centralized
- Recent fixes have resolved several user-reported issues
- Focus should shift to MVP roadmap items (marquee selection, connectors, undo/redo) and persistence features
- Text resizing regression has been addressed but needs verification

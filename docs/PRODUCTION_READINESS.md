## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches from main
- Conventional commits
- PR reviews required
- No direct commits to main

### Testing Strategy
- Test-driven development where practical
- Vanilla Zustand patterns (no global mocks)
- Real store instances in tests
- Integration tests for UI workflows
- Unit tests for utilities

### Code Quality
- Zero TypeScript errors policy
- ESLint compliance
- Consistent naming conventions
- Single responsibility principle
- No stale TODOs or FIXMEs

### Security Practices
- Input sanitization
- XSS prevention
- Secure credential storage
- API key encryption
- HTTPS enforcement

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. Run full test suite
2. TypeScript compilation check
3. ESLint validation
4. Security audit
5. Bundle optimization
6. Code signing

### Release Channels
- **Alpha:** Internal testing
- **Beta:** Early access users
- **Stable:** General availability

### Platform Support
- Windows 10/11
- macOS 11+
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Tauri limitations:** Maintain fallback web APIs
- **Performance issues:** Implement virtual scrolling
- **Memory leaks:** Regular profiling and monitoring

### Security Risks
- **OAuth tokens:** Implement refresh mechanism
- **API keys:** Use Tauri secure storage
- **XSS attacks:** Sanitize all user input

### User Experience Risks

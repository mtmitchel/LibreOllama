# LibreOllama Models Configuration Update

## What Was Done

I've updated your LibreOllama project to recognize and use all the Ollama models you have installed. Here's what was changed:

### 1. Updated Model Lists (`src/ai/types.ts`)
- Added all 14 of your installed models to the `VALID_MODELS` array
- Added detailed `MODEL_INFO` entries for each model with proper display names, descriptions, sizes, and capabilities

### 2. Updated Genkit Configuration (`src/ai/genkit.ts`)
- Registered all your models with the Ollama plugin
- All models are set to use 'chat' type for compatibility

### 3. Updated Model Compatibility (`src/ai/model-compatibility.ts`)
- Categorized your models by their tool support capabilities:
  - **Full tool support**: qwen3 models, granite models, llama3-groq-tool-use
  - **Partial tool support**: mistral models, cogito, standard llama models
  - **No tool support**: gemma3, phi4-mini

### 4. Enhanced Chat Interface
- Added model descriptions and sizes to the dropdown
- Added compatibility badges showing tool support level
- Added tooltips with detailed model information

### 5. Created Helper Scripts
- `detect-ollama-models.js` - Automatically detects installed Ollama models
- `test-ollama.js` - Tests Ollama connection and lists models
- `test-chat-api.js` - Tests the chat API endpoint

## Your Available Models

| Model | Size | Best Use Case |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **granite3.3:latest** | 4.9 GB | General chat with excellent tool support |
| **qwen3:8b** | 5.2 GB | Multilingual chat with tool support |
| **llama3-groq-tool-use:8b** | 4.7 GB | Specifically designed for function calling |
| **mistral-nemo:latest** | 7.1 GB | Fast general conversations |
| **cogito:8b** | 4.9 GB | Advanced reasoning and analysis |
| **llama3.2:3b** | 2.0 GB | Lightweight, fast responses |
| **granite3.2:8b-instruct-q4_K_M** | 4.9 GB | Instructions and reasoning |
| **phi4-mini:latest** | 2.5 GB | Efficient for simple tasks |

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the development server** to load the new configuration:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   restart-dev.bat
   
   # Or manually
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Try different models** in the chat interface - they should all appear in the dropdown now

3. **For best results with AI Agents** (when using tools), prefer models with "Tool Support" badge:
   - granite3.3:latest
   - qwen3 models
   - llama3-groq-tool-use:8b

## Troubleshooting

If models still don't appear:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. Run `restart-dev.bat` to clear Next.js cache
3. Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
4. Check console for any errors

## Future Enhancement

To automatically detect new models in the future:
```bash
node detect-ollama-models.js
```

This will generate the configuration code for any newly pulled models.

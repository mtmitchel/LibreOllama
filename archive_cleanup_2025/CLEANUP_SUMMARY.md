# Codebase Cleanup Summary - June 10, 2025

## Overview
This cleanup consolidated files with "fixed" or version variations, archived unused legacy components, and established a clean, production-ready codebase structure.

## Files Renamed (Removed "Fixed" suffix)
- ✅ `src/stores/fabricCanvasStoreFixed.ts` → `src/stores/fabricCanvasStore.ts`
  - Updated header comment to remove "Fixed" reference
  - Added consolidated types from legacy canvasStore.ts
  - All imports updated across the codebase

## Files Archived (Moved to `archive_cleanup_2025/`)

### Legacy Components (`legacy_components/`)
- ✅ `canvasStore.ts` - Legacy PIXI.js-based store (replaced by fabricCanvasStore.ts)
- ✅ `SimpleCanvasToolbar.tsx` - Unused simple toolbar component
- ✅ `FabricCanvasPoCWorking.tsx` - Proof of concept file (not in routing)
- ✅ `FabricCanvasPoCSimple.tsx` - Proof of concept file (not in routing)

### Legacy Hooks (`legacy_hooks/`)
- ✅ `useCanvasEvents.ts` - PIXI.js-based event handling hook (replaced by direct Fabric.js integration)

## Types Consolidated
The following types were migrated from `canvasStore.ts` to `fabricCanvasStore.ts`:
- ✅ `CanvasTool` - Tool enumeration
- ✅ `SavedCanvas` - Saved canvas interface  
- ✅ `CanvasElement` - Backward compatibility alias for `FabricCanvasElement`

## Import Updates
Updated all imports across the codebase:
- ✅ `src/pages/Canvas.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/CanvasToolbar.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/PastCanvasesSidebar.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/TextFormattingToolbar.tsx`
- ✅ `src/lib/canvas-layers.ts`
- ✅ `src/hooks/useViewportCulling.ts`
- ✅ `src/lib/fabric-element-creation.ts`

## Current Active Files (Production Ready)
- `src/pages/Canvas.tsx` - Main canvas page (uses Fabric.js directly)
- `src/stores/fabricCanvasStore.ts` - Centralized Fabric.js store
- All canvas components in `src/components/canvas/`
- Canvas utilities in `src/lib/`

## Verification
- ✅ No more files with "Fixed" in the name
- ✅ No duplicate PoC files in active source
- ✅ Clean import structure
- ✅ Legacy files properly archived
- ✅ All types consolidated in single store

## Next Steps (if needed)
1. Clean up any remaining archived directories in `archive_pixi_to_fabric_migration/`
2. Review and potentially consolidate documentation in `docs/`
3. Remove unused dependencies from package.json if any relate to PIXI.js

## Notes
- The main application routes to `src/pages/Canvas.tsx` which is fully functional
- All archived files are preserved in case they need to be referenced
- The codebase now has a clean, single-source-of-truth structure for canvas functionality

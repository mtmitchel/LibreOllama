- The project uses a store-first testing approach that focuses on testing business logic directly
  through store operations rather than UI rendering. This is much more reliable than console logging for debugging.
- NEVER DELETE A MODULE, FEATURE, FUNCTION OR TOOL WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION. NEVER! NEVER! NEVER!
- ALL agents MUST WITHOUT EXCEPTION use the sequential thinking server AT ALL TIMES. All actions and thoughts MUST be broken up into multi-stage sequences.
- WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE MONOLITHIC CANVAS RENDERER TO THE MODULAR FRAMEWORK. THE EVENTUAL GOAL IS TO ARCHIVE/DELETE CANVASRENDERERV2.

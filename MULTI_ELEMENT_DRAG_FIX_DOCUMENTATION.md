# Multi-Element Drag Within Sections - Fix Implementation

## Problem Analysis
The issue was in the multi-element drag handler where screen-space deltas were being applied directly to canvas coordinates without proper conversion, and elements within sections were having their coordinate systems broken.

## Root Cause
1. **Screen vs Canvas Coordinates**: The drag delta was calculated in screen coordinates but applied directly to canvas coordinates without accounting for zoom scale
2. **Coordinate System Violation**: Elements within sections use relative coordinates, but the delta was being applied as if they were absolute coordinates
3. **Inefficient Updates**: Individual `handleElementDrop` calls were inefficient and could cause coordinate conversion conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Coordinate Service (`coordinateService.ts`)
Added new utility methods:
- `screenDeltaToCanvasDelta()`: Converts screen-space movement to canvas-space delta accounting for zoom
- `applyDeltaToElement()`: Applies delta while preserving element's coordinate system
- `batchApplyDelta()`: Efficiently processes multiple elements at once

### 2. Fixed Multi-Drag Handler (`KonvaCanvas.tsx`)
**Before (Problematic Logic):**
```typescript
// Screen-space delta applied directly to canvas coordinates
const deltaX = endPointerPos.x - startPointerPos.x;
const deltaY = endPointerPos.y - startPointerPos.y;
const newX = state.initialPos.x + deltaX; // WRONG: mixing coordinate spaces
const newY = state.initialPos.y + deltaY;
```

**After (Corrected Logic):**
```typescript
// Convert screen-space delta to canvas-space delta
const canvasScale = stage.scaleX() || 1;
const canvasDelta = CoordinateService.screenDeltaToCanvasDelta(
  { x: deltaX, y: deltaY },
  canvasScale
);

// Apply delta while preserving coordinate systems
const updates = CoordinateService.batchApplyDelta(
  elementsToUpdate,
  canvasDelta,
  sections
);
```

### 3. Key Improvements
- **Zoom-Aware Deltas**: Screen movement properly converted to canvas movement accounting for zoom level
- **Coordinate System Preservation**: Elements in sections maintain relative coordinates, canvas elements maintain absolute coordinates
- **Atomic Updates**: Single `updateMultipleElements()` call instead of multiple individual updates
- **Performance**: Batch processing reduces re-renders and state update overhead

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Multi-Element Drag Within Sections
1. **Select multiple elements inside a section**
2. **Drag them around within the section**
3. **Result**: Elements move together smoothly, maintaining their relative positions within the section

### ✅ Mixed Selection Drag
1. **Select elements both inside and outside sections**
2. **Drag the selection**
3. **Result**: Section elements move relative to their section, canvas elements move absolutely

### ✅ Zoom-Responsive Dragging
1. **Zoom in/out on canvas**
2. **Drag multiple elements**
3. **Result**: Movement feels consistent regardless of zoom level

### ✅ Single Element Drag (Unchanged)
1. **Select single element in section**
2. **Drag it around**
3. **Result**: Still works correctly using existing handleElementDrop logic

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Conversion Formula
```typescript
// Screen delta to canvas delta
canvasDelta = screenDelta / canvasScale

// Apply to element (preserves coordinate system)
newPosition = element.currentPosition + canvasDelta
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Early Exit**: Skip update if movement is minimal (< 1 pixel)
- **Batch Processing**: Single store update instead of multiple individual updates
- **Validation**: Prevent invalid coordinates from corrupting state
- **History**: Single history entry for entire multi-drag operation

### Error Prevention
- **NaN Detection**: All coordinates validated before application
- **Scale Bounds**: Canvas scale clamped to reasonable bounds (0.01 to 100)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Invalid elements skipped rather than breaking entire operation

## Files Modified
1. `src/features/canvas/utils/coordinateService.ts` - Added delta conversion utilities
2. `src/features/canvas/components/KonvaCanvas.tsx` - Fixed multi-drag coordinate calculation

## Test Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Basic Multi-Element Drag in Section
1. Create a section
2. Add 2-3 rectangles inside the section  
3. Select all rectangles
4. Drag them around within the section
5. **Expected**: They move together smoothly, staying in relative positions

### Scenario 2: Mixed Selection Drag
1. Create a section with 2 elements inside
2. Add 1 element outside the section
3. Select all 3 elements (2 inside, 1 outside)
4. Drag the selection
5. **Expected**: All elements move appropriately relative to their coordinate systems

### Scenario 3: Zoom + Multi-Drag
1. Create section with multiple elements
2. Zoom in significantly (3x)
3. Select multiple elements and drag
4. **Expected**: Movement feels natural and proportional despite zoom

### Scenario 4: Performance Test
1. Create section with 10+ elements
2. Select all and drag rapidly
3. **Expected**: Smooth performance with no lag or visual artifacts

## Regression Prevention
- Single element drag unchanged (still uses handleElementDrop)
- Section drag unchanged (still uses handleSectionDragEnd)  
- Coordinate systems preserved (relative vs absolute)
- Existing store interface maintained
- History/undo functionality preserved

This fix ensures predictable, smooth multi-element dragging within sections while maintaining the existing architecture and performance characteristics of the Canvas system.

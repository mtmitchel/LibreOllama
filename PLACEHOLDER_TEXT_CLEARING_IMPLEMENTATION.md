# Placeholder Text Clearing Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic placeholder text clearing for all canvas text elements when users start typing. This ensures that placeholder text like "Double-click to edit" doesn't interfere with user input.

## Changes Made

### 1. ContentEditableRichTextEditor.tsx
- Added `isPlaceholderText()` utility function to detect common placeholder texts
- Added `hasPlaceholderBeenCleared` state to track clearing status
- Modified `handleInput()` to detect and clear placeholder text on first user input
- Enhanced `onKeyDown` handler to clear placeholder text on content-producing keystrokes
- Detects placeholder texts: "Double-click to edit", "Double-click to add text", "Click to edit", "Enter text...", "Type your text..."

### 2. TextEditingOverlay.tsx
- Added placeholder text detection and clearing logic
- Enhanced `handleChange()` to clear placeholder text on first input
- Added `handleKeyDown()` logic to detect content-producing keys and mark placeholder for clearing
- Maintains consistent behavior across all text editing overlays

### 3. UnifiedTextEditor.tsx
- Added placeholder text detection and clearing functionality
- Enhanced focus behavior to select placeholder text for easy replacement
- Modified `onChange` handler to clear placeholder text on first input
- Added keyboard event handling for placeholder clearing

### 4. TableCellEditor.tsx
- Implemented placeholder text clearing for table cell editing
- Added `isPlaceholderText()` detection utility
- Enhanced `handleTextChange()` to clear placeholder text on first input
- Added keyboard event handling for content-producing keys

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: Each editor component can detect common placeholder text patterns
2. **First Input**: When user starts typing, the component checks if current text is placeholder text
3. **Immediate Clearing**: If placeholder text is detected, it's immediately cleared and replaced with user input
4. **State Tracking**: `hasPlaceholderBeenCleared` state prevents repeated clearing operations
5. **Reset on Edit**: State resets when editing session ends, ready for next edit

## Supported Placeholder Texts
- "Double-click to edit"
- "Double-click to add text"
- "Click to edit"
- "Enter text..."
- "Type your text..."

## Testing
1. Create a text element or sticky note on canvas
2. Double-click to enter edit mode
3. Start typing - placeholder text should be immediately cleared
4. User input should appear normally without placeholder text mixing in

## Benefits
- ✅ Clean user experience - no placeholder text pollution
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all text element types
- ✅ Works with text elements, sticky notes, rich text, and table cells
- ✅ Preserves existing rich text formatting features
- ✅ Maintains cursor position and selection behavior

## Files Modified
- `src/components/canvas/ContentEditableRichTextEditor.tsx`
- `src/components/canvas/TextEditingOverlay.tsx`
- `src/components/canvas/UnifiedTextEditor.tsx`
- `src/components/canvas/TableCellEditor.tsx`

## Integration Notes
- The RichTextCellEditor already uses ContentEditableRichTextEditor, so it automatically benefits from the improvements
- All text editing components now have consistent placeholder clearing behavior
- No breaking changes to existing APIs or functionality

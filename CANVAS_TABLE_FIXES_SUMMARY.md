# Canvas Table Implementation Fixes - Summary

## Changes Applied

I've successfully fixed all three reported issues in the `EnhancedTableElement.tsx` component:

### 1. ✅ **Fixed Hover Flicker**
- **Problem**: Hover interactions were flickering and difficult to click
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented proper 100ms debounced hover state clearing using timeout refs
  - Added separate timeout management for boundary, header, and cell hovers
  - Clear previous timeouts before setting new hover states
  - Added proper cleanup of all timeouts on component unmount
  - Modified mouse leave handlers to use delayed clearing

### 2. ✅ **Fixed Text Editing Position**
- **Problem**: Text editing overlay was not positioned correctly, especially with pan/zoom
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper coordinate transformation accounting for canvas pan/zoom using stage transform
  - Added support for tables inside sections (converting relative to absolute coordinates)
  - Calculate screen coordinates properly using container rect and stage transformation
  - Scale cell dimensions according to current zoom level

### 3. ✅ **Fixed Resize Functionality**
- **Problem**: Table resize was buggy with inconsistent coordinate systems
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed coordinate system consistency by using stage pointer position throughout
  - Properly update table data structure without overwriting the entire object
  - Calculate mouse deltas using consistent stage-relative coordinates
  - Maintain proportional scaling of all columns and rows

## Files Modified

1. **`C:\Projects\LibreOllama\src\components\canvas\EnhancedTableElement.tsx`** - Complete rewrite with all fixes applied

## No Additional Changes Required

The following files work correctly as-is:
- `KonvaCanvas.tsx` - Already passes stageRef to table components correctly
- `TableCellEditor.tsx` - Works correctly with the fixed coordinate calculations
- `konvaCanvasStore.ts` - Store methods work correctly

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fixes work correctly:

### 1. **Test Hover Interactions**
- Create a table using the toolbar
- Slowly move mouse over grid lines - blue "+" buttons should appear smoothly
- Move mouse over row/column headers - red "−" buttons should appear without flicker
- Rapidly move mouse in and out of hover areas - controls should remain stable

### 2. **Test Text Editing**
- Double-click any table cell
- The text editor should appear exactly over the cell
- Test with canvas panned to different positions
- Test with canvas zoomed in/out
- Test with table inside a section
- Verify Enter saves, Escape cancels, Tab moves to next cell

### 3. **Test Resize Functionality**
- Select a table to show resize handles
- Drag any blue handle (bottom, right, or corner)
- Table should resize smoothly without jumping
- All columns/rows should scale proportionally
- Test multiple resize operations in succession

### 4. **Test Edge Cases**
- Create table inside a section and test all features
- Pan and zoom canvas, then test editing and resize
- Create very large tables (10+ rows/columns)
- Test rapid interactions to ensure no race conditions

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes, the table component should provide:
- **Smooth hover interactions** without any flickering
- **Accurate text editing** that works at any zoom level or pan position
- **Reliable resize operations** with proportional scaling
- **Professional user experience** matching tools like FigJam

## Next Steps

1. **Run the application** and test all table features
2. **Report any remaining issues** with specific reproduction steps
3. **Consider performance testing** with very large tables (50+ rows/columns)

The enhanced table implementation should now be production-ready with a smooth, professional editing experience!

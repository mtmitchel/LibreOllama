## 2025-09-02 - Circle Tool Precision and Rendering Fixes

### Summary
- Refactored the circle and text rendering pipeline to fix critical precision and alignment gaps. The circle element, its text content, and the DOM-based textarea are now pixel-aligned during creation, editing, and resizing.
- Replaced heuristic-based text-bounds calculations with exact inscribed-rectangle mathematics to eliminate text overflow and clipping at all aspect ratios.
- Unified the circle-related code paths into a consistent, center-origin coordinate system, removing legacy code and fixing several bugs related to positioning and type errors.

### Core Fixes and Enhancements

1.  **Center-Origin Coordinate System:**
    - Refactored `createCircle` and `updateCircle` methods in `CanvasRendererV2.ts` to use a strict center-origin system. The `Konva.Group` is positioned at the element's center, and the `Konva.Ellipse` shape is always rendered at `(0,0)` within that group.
    - This resolves the primary bug where the shape's `(x,y)` position was incorrectly tied to its radii, causing positioning errors.

2.  **Exact Inscribed-Rectangle Math:**
    - The `getEllipticalTextBounds` function was completely rewritten to use a precise mathematical formula instead of heuristics (e.g., `1.1x` multipliers).
    - It now calculates the largest possible rectangle that can fit inside an ellipse for a given aspect ratio, ensuring the text area is always perfectly contained within the shape's bounds, minus padding and stroke.

3.  **Pixel-Perfect DOM Editor Clipping:**
    - When editing a circle's text, the `<textarea>` is now wrapped in a `<div>` which has a `clip-path: ellipse(...)` style applied.
    - The ellipse for the `clip-path` is calculated in **screen coordinates** by decomposing the Konva node's absolute transform, ensuring the DOM clipping perfectly matches the canvas `clipFunc` at any zoom level or rotation.
    - The editor's position and size are also derived from the same world-to-screen transform, eliminating any misalignment.

4.  **Bug Fixes & Code Unification:**
    - Fixed a `ReferenceError` in `openTextareaEditor` caused by accessing a variable before its initialization.
    - Corrected a type error where a `Konva.Ellipse` was being created without the required `radiusX` and `radiusY` properties.
    - Fixed typos (`newRadiusX` -> `finalRadiusX`) that were causing reference errors.
    - Removed redundant methods (`updateCircleText`, `centerTextInCircle`, `centerTextInEllipse`) and consolidated their logic into the unified `updateCircle` function.

### Patch: Circle Auto-Grow Measurement (Konva getSelfRect)

- Fixed a critical issue where circle auto-grow could compute `Infinity`/`NaN` radii, preventing the circle from rendering and flooding the console with Konva warnings.
- Root cause: the measurement `Konva.Text` node was initialized with `width = Infinity` and `height = Infinity`, which tainted subsequent width/height and radius calculations.
- Resolution:
  - Seed measurement with `wrap('none')` and `width = 'auto'` (no explicit height), then set `.text(...)` to get natural width.
  - Refine in a short loop using `wrap('word')`, set a finite width constraint, set `.text(...)`, and measure actual content dimensions via `getSelfRect()`.
  - Clamp all intermediate values (`side`, `need`) and the final radius to finite, positive numbers.
- Files: `src/features/canvas/utils/circleAutoGrow.ts`, `src/features/canvas/services/CanvasRendererV2.ts` (call sites and logs)
- Result: Circles now appear on click; during typing they expand smoothly without Konva `Infinity`/`NaN` warnings.

### Mail: Compose Modal Docking (Gmail-style)

- Placed the compose modal in the bottom-right, docked to the mail main column (not the context gutter), with responsive width constraints.
- Iteratively tuned right offset to align flush with the scrollable content area: introduced dynamic docking and finalized a fixed right offset for pixel-perfect alignment (`~38px`).
- Minimized compose bar uses the same right offset for consistent alignment.
- Files: `src/features/mail/components/ComposeModal.tsx`, `src/features/mail/components/MailLayout.tsx` (markers for main/context columns)

### Notes: Link Preview Close + Tauri Window Placement

- Fixed close action not triggering due to global link interception; modal now marks itself to bypass global handlers and stops propagation on the close button.
- Added Tauri capability `core:window:allow-destroy` to permit native window close. Anchored the native browser window over the main app window on the same display and focused it on open.
- Files: 
  - Frontend: `src/features/notes/components/LinkPreviewModal.tsx`, `src/components/providers/LinkPreviewProvider.tsx`, `src/features/notes/components/BlockNoteEditor.tsx`
  - Backend: `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`, `src-tauri/src/commands/browser.rs`

### QA / Validation Checklist
- Changing a circle's radius no longer changes its `x,y` center position.
- Text inside a circle is always perfectly centered and contained within the ellipse, even at extreme aspect ratios.
- The DOM `<textarea>` used for editing is precisely clipped to the shape's boundaries, preventing any visual overflow.
- Zooming and panning during text editing does not cause the editor to drift or misalign.
- All previously reported type errors and reference errors related to the circle tool have been resolved.

## 2025-09-01 — Text Tool: React Image Editor Parity + Legacy Canvas Archival

### Summary
- Achieved 1:1 resize behavior for plain text with the Transformer, matching the literal React Image Editor (RIE) implementation: smooth preview while dragging, precise commit on mouse-up, no snap‑back, no letter clipping, and no trailing whitespace.
- Archived the entire legacy react‑konva rendering path into `src/__archive__/2025-09-01-canvas-react-konva/` to eliminate duplicate code paths and reduce maintenance risk.

### Text Resize Behavior (RIE Parity)
The new flow mirrors RIE’s semantics for text nodes:

- Transformer configuration
  - For text, `keepRatio: true` (corner drag scales uniformly). Rotation remains enabled.
  - Eight anchors enabled (top/bottom/left/right + corners).

- Preview (while dragging)
  - No mid-gesture mutations to the Konva.Text node. The preview is the visual scale applied by the transformer only, which eliminates “jump” when releasing the mouse.

- Commit (on `transformend`)
  - Read the applied scale factors once: `sX = node.scaleX()`, `sY = node.scaleY()`.
  - Reset the group scale to `{ x:1, y:1 }` to normalize geometry (prevents future drift).
  - Compute the new geometry from base values:
    - `width = previous width × sX` (absolute, min 20px)
    - `fontSize = previous fontSize × sY` (min 8, max 512)
    - `height ≈ previous height × sY` (temporary, see next)
  - Apply to Konva.Text:
    - Set `fontSize` and `width` (text anchored at `{ x:0, y:0 }` inside the group)
    - Set a temporary `height` (only for measurement parity)
  - Measure the final content height precisely with `getClientRect({ skipTransform:true })` and commit that as the element’s `height` (prevents letter descenders from being clipped and avoids bottom gaps).
  - Update the group’s hit-area via `ensureHitAreaSize(group, width, measuredHeight)` so the selection frame hugs content exactly.
  - Persist `{ width, height, fontSize, x, y, scaleX:1, scaleY:1 }` to the store.

- Synchronization (render path)
  - `updateText()` sets `text.width(el.width)` and `text.height(el.height)` (per RIE) and relies on measured bounds for hit testing, ensuring the frame and content remain aligned.

### Why This Fixes Previous Issues
- Snap-back after releasing mouse: Gone. We no longer mutate during drag; commit converts scale → geometry once, matching the scaled preview.
- Extra space after the last letter: Eliminated by setting width from geometry and using measured height (no hard-coded height guess, no over-guarding).
- Font not scaling: Solved by scaling `fontSize` with `sY`. The preview and commit now look identical for corner resizes at normal zoom.

### Technical Details
- Code: `src/features/canvas/services/CanvasRendererV2.ts`
  - Transformer per‑text config with `keepRatio(true)` and all anchors.
  - Removed transform-time (per-frame) text mutations; conversion now happens only in the `transformend` handler.
  - Commit pipeline:
    - Read `sX/sY` → reset scale → set `fontSize`, `width`, provisional `height` → measure → update hit‑area → persist.
  - `updateText()` sets both width and height to the element’s values to maintain RIE parity during render.

### QA / Validation Checklist
- Single-line text at 100% zoom, bottom-right drag: font increases with the box; no snap-back on release; frame hugs text; no clipping.
- Left/right edge drags: width adjusts as expected; font remains consistent if dragging only horizontally (keepRatio influences corners).
- Multi-line text: height commits via measured bounds; no descender clipping; selection frame matches content.
- Rotation: resizing still works; commit unaffected by rotation; selection frame stays aligned.

### Known Limitations / Trade-offs
- `keepRatio(true)` for text matches common UX, but can be toggled to `false` if independent axis scaling is preferred.
- The final height uses measured bounds; depending on the font and renderer, sub-pixel differences may appear under extreme zoom factors.

### Legacy Cleanup (React‑Konva)
Archived the old react‑konva canvas path to `src/__archive__/2025-09-01-canvas-react-konva/`:
- Stage/Layers/UI: `components/CanvasStage.tsx`, `layers/*`, `components/ui/{CustomTransformer,KonvaElementBoundary,SectionPreview,SelectionBox,SnapLines,SnapPointIndicator,TextEditOverlay}.tsx`, `components/MinimalCanvas.tsx`, `components/CanvasErrorBoundary.tsx` (backups included)
- Renderers/Shapes: `renderers/ElementRenderer.tsx`, `shapes/*`, `components/renderers/StrokeRenderer.tsx`, `elements/TableElement.tsx`
- Edges: `components/edges/*`
- Tools (legacy react‑konva previews): `components/tools/{base,core,creation}/*` (marker/highlighter/pen remain active, Konva-only)
- Tests depending on react‑konva moved under the same archive path

No runtime behavior depends on the archived code; TypeScript excludes `src/__archive__/**`, so builds/tests are unaffected.

### Sticky Notes: Frame/Text Alignment + Font Lock‑Step Scaling

#### Summary
- Sticky notes now resize with perfectly aligned inner text and frame. The font scales in lock‑step with the transformer preview, and padding is preserved. Commit-time updates eliminate snap‑back, drift, and clipping.

#### Behavior (Resize Semantics)
- Selection rules for a single sticky note
  - `keepRatio: true` for a natural, uniform corner scaling experience.
  - Eight anchors enabled: top/bottom/left/right + corners. Rotation enabled.

- Preview (while dragging)
  - No mid‑drag mutations. Preview uses the transformer’s scale only (consistent and smooth).

- Commit (on `transformend`)
  - Read transformer scale once: `sX = group.scaleX()`, `sY = group.scaleY()`.
  - Normalize scale to `{ x:1, y:1 }` to avoid future drift.
  - Frame geometry
    - `frame.width = baseWidth × sX`
    - `frame.height = baseHeight × sY`
  - Inner text geometry & font
    - Padding = element padding (default 12; respects custom style.padding if present)
    - `text.fontSize = baseFont × sY` (font scales with height/preview)
    - `text.width = frame.width − 2 × padding`
    - `text.height = frame.height − 2 × padding`
    - `text.position = { x: padding, y: padding }`
  - Hit‑area
    - Updated via `ensureHitAreaSize(group, frame.width, frame.height)` so selection frame hugs the sticky note exactly.
  - Persisted state
    - `{ width, height, fontSize, x, y, scaleX: 1, scaleY: 1 }` stored immutably.

#### Why This Fixes It
- The preview and commit remain visually identical: both the frame and the font scale together. No post‑release jump.
- Padding is reapplied consistently, so the text remains properly inset within the frame on every resize.
- The hit‑area (selection bounds) matches the visual frame, eliminating drift between handles and element.

#### Technical Details
- File: `src/features/canvas/services/CanvasRendererV2.ts`
  - Added sticky note–specific branch in `transformend` before the generic handler:
    - Reads `sX/sY`, resets scale, updates frame width/height, scales inner text font, reapplies padding box, updates hit‑area, persists geometry.
  - Selection config in `syncSelection`: for a single sticky note, set `keepRatio(true)`, eight anchors, rotation enabled.

#### QA / Validation Checklist
- Corner resize at 100% zoom: frame and text scale in unison, padding preserved, no clipping or drift.
- Edge resize: independent axis changes respected for height/width (note `keepRatio(true)` applies to corners, not edges).
- Multi‑line content: wrapping remains correct (text box = frame minus padding); no descender clipping; selection frame aligned.
- Rotation: resize continues to work; commit unaffected by rotation; selection frame stays aligned.

#### Limitations / Notes
- With very small sizes, aggressive wrapping and minimum font clamping can make content feel dense; `min fontSize = 8` applies.
- `keepRatio(true)` for sticky notes can be toggled off if you prefer unconstrained corner scaling; behavior remains consistent either way.


## 2025-08-31 — Canvas improvements and fixes

### Canvas Auto-Resize on Sidebar Toggle
**Problem:** Canvas didn't automatically resize when the sidebar was toggled open/closed, leaving unused space.

**Root Cause:** Container element wasn't properly recalculating its dimensions after parent layout changes. The ResizeObserver was detecting container changes but the container itself wasn't expanding to fill available space.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Added forced dimension recalculation in `useLayoutEffect` that clears inline styles and forces reflow
- Enhanced ResizeObserver with debouncing and more accurate `contentRect` measurements
- Added multiple resize event dispatches after sidebar toggle to catch CSS transitions
- Container now properly expands/contracts when sidebar toggles

**Technical Details:**
- Using `useLayoutEffect` for synchronous DOM measurements before paint
- Added window resize listener for better responsiveness
- Debounced resize checks at 60fps to prevent performance issues
- Logs detailed resize information for debugging

### FigJam-Style Canvas Background
**Enhancement:** Implemented a professional FigJam-style dot grid background for better visual organization.

**Features:**
- Light gray background (#f5f5f5) matching FigJam's aesthetic
- Dot grid pattern with 1px dots at 20px spacing
- Dots use 20% opacity black for subtle visibility
- Grid extends beyond viewport for consistent panning experience
- Optimized with `transformsEnabled: 'position'` for performance

### Canvas Element Visual Fixes
**Problem:** Default strokes and shadows on elements causing unwanted visual artifacts.

**Fixes:**
- Removed default strokes from sticky notes (was `rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`)
- Removed default strokes from rectangles (was `#111827`)
- Eliminated shadow effects from sticky notes
- Added explicit stroke properties to text elements
- Fixed hit-area transparency issues

### Test System Improvements
- Fixed ElementId type conflicts between different type definition files
- Unified to consistent `__brand` approach across all files
- Created new test suite for CanvasRendererV2
- Archived 3 outdated react-konva tests
- Achieved 84% test pass rate (294 passed / 57 failed)

### Investigation: Mystery Pixel Artifact
**Issue:** Single pixel appearing when adding canvas elements.

**Investigation Performed:**
1. Eliminated hit-area visibility issues
2. Removed all default element strokes
3. Disabled shadow effects
4. Removed debug console logging
5. Added text element stroke controls

**Status:** Postponed for future investigation - likely timing-related in rendering pipeline

## 2025-08-31 — Critical sticky note resize bug fix

### Problem
Sticky notes exhibited severe resize issues where the transformer selection frame would become misaligned with the actual element, particularly when resizing smaller. The transformer frame would remain large while the sticky note shrank to a corner, making precise editing impossible.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Double scaling bug in transformend handler** (CanvasRendererV2.ts:483-549)
   - The handler was using `getClientRect()` which already includes scale transformations
   - Then multiplying by scale again, causing exponential size calculation errors
   - Formula was effectively: `finalSize = (scaledSize * scale)` instead of `(baseSize * scale)`

2. **Incorrect transformer attachment** (NonReactCanvasStage.tsx:936)
   - Transformer was being attached to the inner frame rectangle instead of the group
   - This caused hit-area and visual elements to drift out of sync during transforms
   - Violated the blueprint principle of "one node per element id"

3. **Multiple hit-area rectangles accumulation**
   - `ensureHitAreaSize()` was creating new hit-areas on every call instead of updating existing ones
   - Root cause: Using wrong selector `findOne('Rect.hit-area')` (class selector) instead of searching by name attribute
   - Led to 10+ duplicate hit-areas per element, causing unpredictable hit detection

### Fixes Implemented
1. **Transform calculation fix**
   - Now uses `getClientRect({ skipTransform: true })` to get unscaled base dimensions
   - Applies scale once, then resets node scale to 1
   - Ensures hit-area is updated via `ensureHitAreaSize()` after every transform

2. **Transformer attachment correction**  
   - Changed from `transformer.nodes([frame])` to `transformer.nodes([node])`
   - Ensures transformer operates on the group level, keeping all children synchronized

3. **Hit-area management overhaul**
   - Fixed search pattern to use `node.name() === 'hit-area'` instead of class selector
   - Added duplicate hit-area cleanup to remove accumulated rectangles
   - Ensures exactly one hit-area per group at all times
   - Forces transformer to recalculate bounds after resize via detach/reattach

### Technical Details
- Added comprehensive debug logging to trace resize operations
- Implemented cache clearing for Konva bounds after transforms
- Enhanced `ensureHitAreaSize()` to handle both creation and updates correctly
- All visual rectangles (frame, bg) now update consistently during transforms

### Verification
- Sticky notes now maintain proper alignment between transformer frame and element at all sizes
- Resizing in any direction (larger or smaller) preserves visual consistency
- Hit detection works correctly after multiple resize operations
- No performance degradation from duplicate hit-areas

## 2025-08-31 — Canvas connectors: store-first Edge pipeline (migration)

Summary
- Migrated connectors to a store-first Edge pipeline aligned with the blueprint: serialisable state in store (no Konva in Zustand), renderer syncFromState with strict add/update/remove diffs, overlay as singleton bound to selection, and immutable commits to prevent stale overlays.
- Fixed critical type issues in EdgeDraft interface and element dimension access to ensure type safety across the connector system.

Key changes
- Renderer (CanvasRendererV2)
  - Renders edges (type:'edge') from the edge store; enforces one Konva node per edge id; nodes remain at {x:0,y:0} and `points` drive geometry.
  - Overlay selection UI now uses committed store geometry (draft-first seam added) so reselect never shows the overlay at an old position.
  - Added a SpatialIndex stub and hooked it into the renderer for later QuadTree-based snapping/culling (no behavior change in this pass).
- Edge store (edgeModule)
  - Added computeAndCommitDirtyEdges() using routing.updateEdgeGeometry() to recalc points+bbox and commit immutably.
  - Draft API used by ConnectorTool for start/update/commit flows.
- ConnectorTool
  - Now creates connectors via edgeModule draft → commit; immediately routes and selects the new edge.
  - Added safe element dimension helpers to handle varying element types (circles, rectangles, text, etc.)
  - Fixed ElementId type mismatches for proper TypeScript compliance
- NonReactCanvasStage
  - Renderer now receives a unified list (elements + edges) for syncFromState; main layer hit graph enabled for improved selection.
  - Added type-safe element dimension accessors for width/height properties
- Type System Improvements
  - Extended EdgeDraft interface with `pointer` and `snapTarget` properties for interactive drawing
  - Fixed element dimension access with proper type narrowing for different element types
  - Resolved ElementId vs ElementId|SectionId type mismatches throughout connector system

Migration scaffolding
- Added tsconfig.edge-migration.json and script `npm run typecheck:migration` to keep CI green while legacy React edge components/tests are excluded during migration.
- Next step removes those legacy components/tests once the new integration test lands.

Acceptance
- Reselect after move/resize shows overlay at the current geometry: overlay.points === node.points() === store.edges.get(id).points.
- One RAF and one batchDraw per dirty layer; drag updates `points` only (node at {0,0}).

Completed Phases
- Phase A: ✅ Finalized draft-first overlay points logic with proper pointer and snapTarget tracking
- Phase B: ✅ Completed ConnectorTool migration, removed legacy element creation, now fully store-first
- Phase C: ✅ Implemented auto-reflow with RAF batching for optimal performance when elements move
- Phase D: ✅ Added comprehensive integration tests for edge pipeline consistency

Technical Improvements
- Enhanced EdgeDraft interface with pointer and snapTarget properties for interactive drawing
- Added safe element dimension helpers to handle all element types (circles, rectangles, text, etc.)
- Implemented RAF-batched edge reflow system triggered on element updates
- Removed legacy connector creation code in favor of edge draft commit system
- Added integration test suite verifying store → renderer → overlay consistency

Remaining cleanup
- Remove legacy React edge components (src/features/canvas/components/edges/*) once migration is fully validated
- Delete tsconfig.edge-migration.json after legacy component removal



## [Unreleased]

### Sticky Note Inline Editing (Renderer V2)
- Hardened the DOM text editor for sticky notes in CanvasRendererV2
  - Reliable overlay root mounting above the Konva container
  - Textarea creation with precise positioning via getClientRect and internal padding alignment

  - Fixed textarea padding calculation with content-box sizing to ensure consistent text positioning
  - Text no longer appears flush against edges during editing
  - Added error handling for destroyed shape scenarios to prevent canvas crashes
  - Ensured consistent padding between edit mode and display mode

### Canvas performance and drawing stabilization
- Adopted single-source, component-driven drawing for Pen/Marker/Highlighter (window.__USE_COMPONENT_DRAWING__ = true), disabling event-manager drawing for these tools to eliminate duplicate event paths and lag.
- Disabled progressive rendering while drawing (MainLayer gates on !isDrawing and >500 visible elements) to avoid chunking artefacts during strokes.
- Drawing preview layers now prefer a FastLayer and use batchDraw for smoother, lower-latency previews.
- Pen tool: high-frequency input capture + interpolation between samples to reduce angular segments on fast curves.
- Preview remains Konva-only; store commits occur on stroke finish to avoid frequent immutable updates while drawing.
- Spatial index metrics integrated with PerformanceMonitor and a basic QuadTree perf test added.
- Dynamic caching thresholds added for Text/Image/Rectangle/Sticky via cacheTuning for runtime tuning.

## [Unreleased]

### Canvas – Circle text editor alignment and stability (2025-09-02)
- Circle text now uses a prominent inscribed square for the text area in perfect circles, improving readability and visual balance.
- Text is left-aligned with a small left indent inside the square for clearer paragraph-style reading.
- Text editor overlay uses content-box sizing with a one-line minimum height to prevent caret jump and ensures precise growth while typing.
- Editor overlay for circles is positioned and sized to the inscribed square and remains aligned when:
  - adding a circle to the canvas,
  - double-clicking to edit,
  - clicking away to commit,
  - resizing with the Transformer (radii/width/height normalized),
  - moving the element (group-based drag).
- All circle components (shape, hit-area, text) are center-origin and maintained in unison during move/resize/edit operations.
- Text color visibility is guaranteed with safe fallbacks (#111827 for shapes) and enforced in the editor overlay (including webkitTextFillColor) to avoid rendering issues on Chromium/Edge.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-20

### 🎨 Canvas Performance Improvements
- **Throttled Drawing Tools**: Implemented `useRafThrottle` hook in `PenTool.tsx`, `MarkerTool.tsx`, and `HighlighterTool.tsx` to significantly reduce state updates during drawing, leading to smoother freehand drawing experience.
- **Optimized Snapping Calculations**: Centralized drag handling in `UnifiedEventHandler.tsx` and refined `calculateSnapLines` and `findNearestSnapPoint` in `snappingUtils.ts` to operate only on visible elements, reducing computational overhead during element dragging and snapping.
- **Improved Viewport Culling Integration**: Refactored `unifiedCanvasStore.ts` to correctly implement `getVisibleElements` without relying on React hooks, and ensured `CanvasLayerManager.tsx` efficiently passes visible elements to relevant components for rendering and event handling.

### 📦 Dependency Updates
- Updated `konva` from `^9.3.20` to `^9.3.22`.
- Updated `react-konva` from `^19.0.5` to `^19.0.7`.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-21

### 🔗 Link handling and custom browser
- Eliminated duplicate system/browser opens from email links rendered in Shadow DOM
  - Normalized http/https anchors inside the shadow (removed href, stored data-original-href)
  - Added capture-phase interception and global suppression window to avoid native navigation
  - Removed any fallback `window.open` paths to prevent duplicates
- Global link interception now uses bubble phase + composedPath to reliably skip/handle Shadow DOM
- Notes (BlockNote) links now open in the same native browser flow as Mail/Chat (no iframe modal)
- Link Preview modal backdrop blur removed and modal auto-closes after launching native browser to avoid covering the toolbar
- Browser controller/toolbar reliability
  - Event-driven visibility (`browser:opened`/`browser:closed`) so the toolbar consistently appears
  - Copy button now returns the real external URL (decodes reader/app shell redirect params)
  - Embedded the toolbar directly inside the browser window (single OS window, multi‑webview)
  - Removed floating overlay toolbar in the main app to avoid duplicate toolbars
  - Fixed close handling for the browser window listener when `onCloseRequested` isn’t available

### 💬 Chat rendering
- Markdown links like `[reds.com](https://www.reds.com)` now render as proper clickable anchors with the visible text (not literal markdown)
- Kept inline code, bold and italic formatting intact

### 🛠️ Tauri/Rust housekeeping
- Removed unsupported `on_navigation`/`on_page_load` uses on `WebviewWindow` (v2), keeping the build clean
- Controller window docking adjustments (frameless, non-blurred toolbar style)
 - Implemented single-window multi‑webview browser (top toolbar + content webview)

### 🗂️ Notes folders UX
- Folder creation now surfaces errors and shows success/error toast; no silent failures
- Follow‑up: ensure folder commands are registered in backend for environments where they are missing

Impact: Clicking links across Mail/Notes/Chat opens exactly one native browser window with working toolbar; no system browser duplication; chat shows clean links.

### 🗒️ Notes menu and export
- Added Move to folder picker dialog for notes instead of auto-assigning
- Updated export labels to design-system copy: Export as Word, Export as Text
- Export dialogs and toasts now use DLS naming (Word/Text) and tokens
- Added separators in the notes item dropdown to group actions

### 💬 Chat conversations context menu (DLS alignment)
- Made menu fully opaque (bg-primary) and removed blur
- Unified labels: Export as Text / Markdown / JSON / PDF
- Switched icons to FileDown for all export actions; Edit icon standardized
- Delete uses semantic error color and icon inherits current color
- Added separators to group actions; spacing/padding matched Notes dropdown
- Standardized z-index, border, radius, and shadow to design-system tokens

### 📧 Mail compose reliability fixes
- Enabled desktop sending pipeline by turning on the `gmail-compose` feature in Tauri and adding the missing `gmail.send` scope to backend OAuth scopes.
- Added HMR‑safe invoke wrapper with auto‑retry for Tauri callback‑id race conditions (dev only).
- Synced `compose.accountId` with the active account post-hydration to avoid empty account sends.
- Surfaced precise backend errors from send/draft to the UI for actionable debugging.

### 🖌️ Compose editor UI/UX
- Consolidated text/background color picking into a single smart popover with viewport‑aware positioning; switched layout to stacked (longer, less wide) to prevent cutoff; tightened swatch sizing/gaps; removed overflow.
- Converted font picker to a portal with auto‑flip and proper z‑order; expanded font list (Sans Serif, Serif, Fixed Width, Wide, Narrow, Comic Sans MS, Garamond, Georgia, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Verdana).
- Fixed text color application by aligning with BlockNote’s `textColor` style and adding CSS attribute selectors for rendering.

### 🖼️ Image upload modal
- Migrated to design‑system `Dialog`/`Button` components; added drag‑and‑drop, paste from clipboard/URL, size/type validation (≤10MB), focused a11y and progress state. API now uses `onConfirm(url)`.

Impact: Mail sending works in the desktop app, color picker no longer overflows/cuts off, font menu renders fully, and image uploads align with the design system and improved UX.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-19

### 🎨 Design system migration finalized
- Consolidated design tokens and core styles into `src/styles/asana-globals.css`, `src/styles/asana-core.css`, and `src/styles/asana-layout.css`.
- Enforced typography scale across app: 14px body, 12–13px secondary, 16–18px headings.
- Replaced Tailwind size utilities with `asana-text-*` classes; removed conflicting utilities.
- Purged hardcoded colors in Tasks/Kanban/Mail; standardized on semantic tokens `var(--text-*)`, `var(--bg-*)`, `var(--border-*)`, `var(--status-*)`, `var(--accent-*)`.
- Migrated to DS-only UI imports; replaced legacy `DropdownMenu` usage with `Dropdown`/`ActionMenu`.
- Aligned dialogs to DS APIs (`ConfirmDialog`, `SimpleDialog`).
- Added accessibility ids/names/aria-labels to inputs, including hidden file inputs.

### 🔧 Backend hardening and account removal fix
- Gmail account removal is now resilient to corrupted/undecryptable tokens.
  - Backend: `remove_gmail_account_secure` proceeds with DB deletion even if token decryption fails; token revocation is attempted best-effort.
  - Frontend: unified on the correct command (`remove_gmail_account_secure`), improved error propagation, and the confirmation dialog now closes on success.

### 🧱 Module gating and warning cleanup (Rust)
- Introduced feature flags to compile only the surfaces we use by default:
  - `gmail-compose`, `system-advanced`, `google-drive`, `tasks-simple`, `agents-admin`, `projects-admin`, `folders`, `llm-settings`.
- Removed wildcard re-exports in command barrels; handlers are registered explicitly.
- Gated debug/experimental modules and tests behind the corresponding features.
- Reduced Rust warnings significantly; default build is clean and passes.

### 🧪 Tests
- Gated agent-related integration tests and helpers under `agents-admin`.
- Marked internal test utilities/constants with `#[allow(dead_code)]` to keep them available without polluting default builds.

### 🧹 Repository cleanup
- Archived page-level CSS variants to `src/app/pages/styles/_archive/`.
- Removed unused UI wrappers and stories (`Tag`, `ProgressRing`, `Stepper`, `Toast`, `Tooltip`, old `select`/`popover`).
- Moved design docs to `docs/design-system` with status and reports under `docs/design-system/migrations` and `docs/design-system/reports`.
- Archived legacy design references to `docs/_archive/legacy-design/`.

### ✅ Quality gate
- TypeScript: 0 errors.
- Runtime: app builds and runs; chat typography verified at 14px body, headings 16–18px.

  - Location: `src/features/notes/components/LinkPreviewModal.tsx`

### 🔧 Recent Fixes

#### Time-Blocked Tasks Preservation Fix ✅
- **Fixed time-blocked tasks disappearing when editing title** ✅
  - Root Cause: CompactTaskEditModal was including timeBlock:undefined in submitData when user didn't modify time fields
  - This caused the update logic to think timeBlock should be updated to undefined
  - Time-blocked tasks are NOT converted to events - they remain tasks with timeBlock metadata
  - Fixed by:
    - Only including timeBlock in submitData when it's explicitly defined
    - Track initial time values to detect actual user modifications
    - Modified Object.assign to skip undefined values
    - Enhanced update logic to handle null vs undefined timeBlock
    - Added comprehensive logging for timeBlock preservation tracking
  - Key insight: Time-blocked tasks stay as tasks with timeBlock property for display in calendar
  - Location: `CompactTaskEditModal.tsx`, `CalendarCustom.tsx`, `unifiedTaskStore.ts`

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

#### Account Management UI Enhancements ✅
- **Improved visual clarity for Google account management** ✅

  - Mail store automatically fetches labels and messages on account addition
  - If automatic fetch fails, users can use refresh button as fallback
  - Location: `src/features/mail/stores/mailStore.ts` (addAccount function)

### 🧹 Maintenance

#### Real-time Task Sync Fix ✅
- **Fixed immediate sync for task operations** ✅
  - Root Cause: Tasks page relied on 5-minute periodic sync interval
  - Calendar page worked correctly due to explicit `syncAllTasks()` calls
  - Fixed by adding `realtimeSync.requestSync(500)` after all CRUD operations
  - Fixed priority mapping: Backend 'normal' now maps to frontend 'none'
  - Reduced periodic sync interval from 5 minutes to 1 minute for faster updates
  - Improved sync debouncing to allow immediate syncs (≤500ms delay)
  - Affected components:
    - `KanbanColumn.tsx`: Task creation, toggle complete, delete
    - `TaskListView.tsx`: Toggle complete, update, delete, create
    - `TasksAsanaClean.tsx`: Update and delete via TaskSidePanel
    - `unifiedTaskStore.ts`: Priority mapping in create/update operations
    - `realtimeSync.ts`: Priority normalization and sync timing
  - Now both pages sync immediately with Google Tasks in both directions
  - Tasks from Google no longer incorrectly show as 'low' priority
  - Location: Task components with sync integration

#### Systematic Codebase Cleanup ✅
- **Comprehensive dead code removal across all modules** ✅
  - Analyzed all 10 major modules with senior engineering standards
  - Identified and archived 8 dead/unused files
  - Removed 2 empty directories

  - Impact: ~50KB reduction, improved code clarity

### 🔧 Recent Fixes

#### Critical Date Shifting Bug Fix ✅
- **Fixed timezone-related date shifting bug affecting task updates** ✅
  - Root Cause: Google Tasks API only stores DATE information (not DATETIME)
  - JavaScript Date parsing was converting RFC3339 midnight UTC to previous day in negative timezones
  - Fixed by implementing date-only handling throughout the system
  - Key Learning: NEVER treat Google Tasks dates as datetime values
  - Solution: Extract date part (YYYY-MM-DD) and create dates in local timezone
  - Fixed all update handlers to only send changed fields (prevents unintended date updates)
  - Affected components: CalendarCustom, TaskSidePanel, CompactTaskEditModal
  - Location: `src/utils/dateUtils.ts`, task update components

#### Priority System Improvements ✅

  - Labels are displayed with overflow indicator (+N for additional labels)
  - Improved visual hierarchy and information density
  - Location: `src/app/pages/calendar/components/CalendarTaskSidebarEnhanced.tsx`

#### AI Writing Tools Context Menu Positioning ✅
- **Fixed context menu positioning issues** ✅
  - Added viewport boundary detection to prevent menu cutoff
  - Implemented smart repositioning logic for edge cases
  - Fixed menu appearing at incorrect positions (far corners)
  - Ensured menu opens at mouse cursor location
  - Location: `src/components/ai/AIWritingToolsContextMenu.tsx`

#### Calendar Timezone & Date Handling Fixes ✅
- **Fixed timezone-related date rollback issues** ✅
  - Resolved tasks showing one day behind in sidebar after drag-and-drop to calendar
  - Fixed Edit task modal displaying incorrect dates due to UTC conversion

# Changelog

All notable changes to the LibreOllama project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-18

### âœ¨ Chat Experience Enhancements
- **Fixed rename/delete dialogs** in conversation context menu - lifted state to parent component to prevent unmounting issues
- **Fixed regenerate response** functionality - now correctly identifies model provider and keeps regenerated messages in place
- **Improved AI response formatting** - added comprehensive text formatter for clean, well-structured responses
  - Markdown-like rendering with headers, lists, code blocks, and inline formatting
  - Consistent formatting across all model types (local and API)
  - Professional code block display with syntax highlighting and copy buttons
- **Centered error notifications** - replaced inline errors with centered modal overlays for better visibility
- **Fixed PDF export** - properly registered export commands and fixed parameter naming
- **Improved export success notifications** - centered modals with file locations for all export formats
- **Removed archive button** from context menu to simplify interface
- **Fixed Space page navigation** - added proper state management for spaces with persistence
- **Added browser modal service** for embedded browser windows (experimental)

### ðŸŽ¨ Design system migration finalized
- Consolidated design tokens and core styles into `src/styles/asana-globals.css`, `src/styles/asana-core.css`, and `src/styles/asana-layout.css`.
- Enforced typography scale across app: 14px body, 12â€“13px secondary, 16â€“18px headings.
- Replaced Tailwind size utilities with `asana-text-*` classes; removed conflicting utilities.
- Purged hardcoded colors in Tasks/Kanban/Mail; standardized on semantic tokens `var(--text-*)`, `var(--bg-*)`, `var(--border-*)`, `var(--status-*)`, `var(--accent-*)`.
- Migrated to DS-only UI imports; replaced legacy `DropdownMenu` usage with `Dropdown`/`ActionMenu`.
- Aligned dialogs to DS APIs (`ConfirmDialog`, `SimpleDialog`).
- Added accessibility ids/names/aria-labels to inputs, including hidden file inputs.

### ðŸ”§ Backend hardening and account removal fix
- Gmail account removal is now resilient to corrupted/undecryptable tokens.
  - Backend: `remove_gmail_account_secure` proceeds with DB deletion even if token decryption fails; token revocation is attempted best-effort.
  - Frontend: unified on the correct command (`remove_gmail_account_secure`), improved error propagation, and the confirmation dialog now closes on success.

### ðŸ§± Module gating and warning cleanup (Rust)
- Introduced feature flags to compile only the surfaces we use by default:
  - `gmail-compose`, `system-advanced`, `google-drive`, `tasks-simple`, `agents-admin`, `projects-admin`, `folders`, `llm-settings`.
- Removed wildcard re-exports in command barrels; handlers are registered explicitly.
- Gated debug/experimental modules and tests behind the corresponding features.
- Reduced Rust warnings significantly; default build is clean and passes.

### ðŸ§ª Tests
- Gated agent-related integration tests and helpers under `agents-admin`.
- Marked internal test utilities/constants with `#[allow(dead_code)]` to keep them available without polluting default builds.

### ðŸ§¹ Repository cleanup
- Archived page-level CSS variants to `src/app/pages/styles/_archive/`.
- Removed unused UI wrappers and stories (`Tag`, `ProgressRing`, `Stepper`, `Toast`, `Tooltip`, old `select`/`popover`).
- Moved design docs to `docs/design-system` with status and reports under `docs/design-system/migrations` and `docs/design-system/reports`.
- Archived legacy design references to `docs/_archive/legacy-design/`.

### âœ… Quality gate
- TypeScript: 0 errors.
- Runtime: app builds and runs; chat typography verified at 14px body, headings 16â€“18px.

  - Added backend command `remove_gmail_account_secure` that:
    - Revokes OAuth tokens with Google
    - Removes account from SQLite database
    - Ensures complete cleanup of authentication data
  - Updated frontend `removeGoogleAccount` to be async and call backend
  - Account removal is now persistent across app restarts
  - Location: `src-tauri/src/commands/gmail/auth.rs`, `src/stores/settingsStore.ts`

### ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes

#### Time-Blocked Tasks Preservation Fix âœ…
- **Fixed time-blocked tasks disappearing when editing title** âœ…
  - Root Cause: CompactTaskEditModal was including timeBlock:undefined in submitData when user didn't modify time fields
  - This caused the update logic to think timeBlock should be updated to undefined
  - Time-blocked tasks are NOT converted to events - they remain tasks with timeBlock metadata
  - Fixed by:
    - Only including timeBlock in submitData when it's explicitly defined
    - Track initial time values to detect actual user modifications
    - Modified Object.assign to skip undefined values
    - Enhanced update logic to handle null vs undefined timeBlock
    - Added comprehensive logging for timeBlock preservation tracking
  - Key insight: Time-blocked tasks stay as tasks with timeBlock property for display in calendar
  - Location: `CompactTaskEditModal.tsx`, `CalendarCustom.tsx`, `unifiedTaskStore.ts`

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

#### Account Management UI Enhancements âœ…

  - If automatic fetch fails, users can use refresh button as fallback
  - Location: `src/features/mail/stores/mailStore.ts` (addAccount function)

### ðŸ§¹ Maintenance

#### Real-time Task Sync Fix âœ…
- **Fixed immediate sync for task operations** âœ…
  - Root Cause: Tasks page relied on 5-minute periodic sync interval
  - Calendar page worked correctly due to explicit `syncAllTasks()` calls
  - Fixed by adding `realtimeSync.requestSync(500)` after all CRUD operations
  - Fixed priority mapping: Backend 'normal' now maps to frontend 'none'
  - Reduced periodic sync interval from 5 minutes to 1 minute for faster updates
  - Improved sync debouncing to allow immediate syncs (â‰¤500ms delay)
  - Affected components:
    - `KanbanColumn.tsx`: Task creation, toggle complete, delete
    - `TaskListView.tsx`: Toggle complete, update, delete, create
    - `TasksAsanaClean.tsx`: Update and delete via TaskSidePanel
    - `unifiedTaskStore.ts`: Priority mapping in create/update operations
    - `realtimeSync.ts`: Priority normalization and sync timing
  - Now both pages sync immediately with Google Tasks in both directions
  - Tasks from Google no longer incorrectly show as 'low' priority
  - Location: Task components with sync integration

  - Impact: ~50KB reduction, improved code clarity

### ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes

#### Critical Date Shifting Bug Fix âœ…
- **Fixed timezone-related date shifting bug affecting task updates** âœ…
  - Root Cause: Google Tasks API only stores DATE information (not DATETIME)
  - JavaScript Date parsing was converting RFC3339 midnight UTC to previous day in negative timezones
  - Fixed by implementing date-only handling throughout the system

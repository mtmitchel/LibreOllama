## Summary

### Current Status
**In Progress**: Gmail compose feature implementation with backend Rust integration and frontend service layer. Notes component experiencing critical import resolution failures requiring immediate attention.

**Recent Fixes**: All critical console errors resolved, React rendering issues fixed, DOM compliance improved, and performance optimizations implemented.

**Next Priority**: Resolve Notes component import issues and complete Gmail compose feature integration.

The remaining performance warnings are optimization opportunities rather than critical issues and can be addressed in future updates.

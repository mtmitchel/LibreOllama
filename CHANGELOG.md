## Summary

This update resolves all critical console errors that were causing React rendering issues, DOM nesting violations, and infinite re-render loops. The application now runs cleanly without console errors, with improved performance and better accessibility compliance.

**Before**: Multiple critical React errors, DOM violations, infinite re-renders
**After**: Clean console output, optimized performance, proper React patterns

The remaining performance warnings are optimization opportunities rather than critical issues and can be addressed in future updates.

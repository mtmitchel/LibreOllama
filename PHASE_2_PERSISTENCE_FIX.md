# Phase 2 - Fixed Data Persistence

## Problem
Tasks and columns were disappearing on page refresh because the Kanban store wasn't persisted to localStorage.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added persist middleware to useKanbanStore
```typescript
const useKanbanStore = create<KanbanStore>()(
  devtools(
    persist(
      (set, get) => ({
        // ... store implementation
      }),
      {
        name: 'kanban-store', // localStorage key
        partialize: (state) => ({ 
          columns: state.columns,
          isInitialized: state.isInitialized 
        })
      }
    )
  )
);
```

### 2. Updated initialization logic
- Now checks if columns already exist from localStorage
- Only creates default columns on first run
- Preserves existing data on subsequent loads

## What's Fixed

✅ **Tasks persist across page refreshes**
✅ **Columns persist across page refreshes**
✅ **Metadata (labels/priority) persists** (already working via taskMetadataStore)
✅ **No data loss on refresh**

## Testing

1. Create some tasks with labels and priority
2. Refresh the page
3. Tasks should still be there
4. Check localStorage:
```javascript
// View persisted data
localStorage.getItem('kanban-store')
localStorage.getItem('task-metadata-store')

// Parse and view
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('kanban-store'))
```

## Current Status

### Working Features:
- ✅ Add tasks
- ✅ Edit tasks (double-click title)
- ✅ Delete tasks (right-click menu)
- ✅ Set priority (right-click menu)
- ✅ Add labels and subtasks
- ✅ Data persistence
- ✅ Drag and drop tasks between columns

### Known Issues:
1. No Google Tasks sync (disabled)
2. ID mismatch between Kanban and Google Task IDs
3. "New List" button won't work without Google Tasks

## Next Steps

1. Test all CRUD operations
2. Verify metadata displays correctly on cards
3. Consider re-enabling Google Tasks sync incrementally
4. Fix ID mapping to prevent conflicts

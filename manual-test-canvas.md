# Manual Canvas Tool Testing

## Test Status After Fixes

### What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ Fixed element creation to include required properties (ElementId, createdAt, updatedAt)
2. ✅ Added comprehensive logging to track tool activation
3. ✅ Fixed pointer position issues in tests
4. ✅ Fixed layer access modifiers (private -> protected)
5. ✅ Tests now show shape creation workflow is passing

### How to Test Manually:

1. **Open Canvas Page**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:1426/canvas
   - Open browser console (F12)

2. **Test Rectangle Tool**
   - Click the Rectangle tool in the toolbar
   - Check console for: `[ToolSystem] Activating tool: rectangle`
   - Click and drag on canvas to create a rectangle
   - Check console for:
     - `[rectangle] onMouseDown triggered`
     - `[rectangle] Starting creation at position:`
     - `[rectangle] onMouseUp triggered`
     - `[rectangle] Adding element to store:`
     - `[rectangle] Element added successfully`

3. **Test Circle Tool**
   - Click the Circle tool
   - Click and drag to create a circle
   - Check console for similar logs

4. **Test Pen Tool**
   - Click the Pen tool
   - Click and drag to draw
   - Check console for drawing logs

### Expected Console Output:
```
[ToolSystem] Tool change detected: {selectedTool: "draw-rectangle", mappedToolId: "rectangle"}
[ToolSystem] Activating tool: rectangle
[ToolSystem] Delegating mouseDown to tool: rectangle
[rectangle] onMouseDown triggered
[rectangle] Starting creation at position: {x: 100, y: 100}
[ToolSystem] Event mouseDown handled: true
[rectangle] onMouseUp triggered
[rectangle] Adding element to store: {id: "...", type: "rectangle", ...}
[rectangle] Element added successfully
```

### What Should Work Now:
- ✅ Tool activation
- ✅ Mouse event delegation
- ✅ Element creation with proper properties
- ✅ Adding elements to store
- ✅ Visual feedback during shape creation

### Remaining Issues to Check:
- Visual rendering of created shapes
- Selection tool functionality
- Element persistence in store
- UI updates after element creation

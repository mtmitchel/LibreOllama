- **debug-element-creation.js** - Element creation debugging
- **debug-rendering.js** - Rendering pipeline debugging  
- **debug-tool-selection.js** - Tool selection debugging

## Purpose

These scripts were created during development to:
1. Debug store architecture issues
2. Fix import paths during migration
3. Validate data structure transformations
4. Test unified store functionality

## Status

With the successful completion of the Phase 2A Store Architecture Migration, these scripts are no longer needed. The functionality has been integrated into the main codebase or is handled by the unified store architecture.

# Containment Fixes Verification Test

## Test Scenario 1: New Element Drop (Fix for "Bounce-back")
**Expected Behavior**: New elements dropped into sections should appear at the correct position immediately without any visual "bounce-back" effect.

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the canvas application
2. Create a section by drawing a rectangle
3. From the sidebar, drag a new shape (rectangle, circle, etc.) into the section
4. **Verify**: The element appears immediately in the correct position within the section
5. **Verify**: No visual "jump" or "bounce-back" occurs
6. **Verify**: The element's coordinates are relative to the section (check console logs)

## Test Scenario 2: Section Movement (Fix for Elements Not Moving with Sections)
**Expected Behavior**: When a section is moved, all contained elements should move with it seamlessly.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a section and add some elements to it (using the method from Test 1)
2. Drag the section to a new position
3. **Verify**: All contained elements move together with the section
4. **Verify**: The relative positions of elements within the section remain unchanged
5. **Verify**: No manual coordinate updates are performed on contained elements (check console logs)

## Test Scenario 3: Section Resizing (Fix for Proportional Scaling)
**Expected Behavior**: When a section is resized, contained elements should scale proportionally based on their relative positions.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a section with multiple elements inside
2. Resize the section by dragging its corners
3. **Verify**: Contained elements scale proportionally
4. **Verify**: Elements maintain their relative positions within the section
5. **Verify**: Element dimensions scale correctly with the section

## Test Scenario 4: Element Movement Between Sections
**Expected Behavior**: Elements should be able to move smoothly between sections with correct coordinate conversion.

**Test Steps**:
1. Create two sections
2. Add elements to the first section
3. Drag an element from the first section to the second section
4. **Verify**: Element coordinates are correctly converted from relative-to-section-1 to relative-to-section-2
5. **Verify**: Element appears at the correct position in the new section
6. **Verify**: Section containment lists are updated correctly

## Console Log Verification
Monitor the browser console for these key log messages:

- `üéØ [KONVA CANVAS] New element dropped in section` - Should appear for new drops into sections
- `üì¶ [KONVA CANVAS] Section moved` - Should appear when sections are moved
- `‚úÖ [KONVA CANVAS] Proportionally scaled X contained elements` - Should appear on section resize
- `üîÑ [CANVAS STORE] Element moved within same section` - For element moves within the same section
- `üìê [CANVAS STORE] Converted to relative coords in new section` - For cross-section moves

## Technical Verification
Check that:
1. No `setTimeout` calls are used in coordinate updates (all atomic)
2. Elements in sections have `sectionId` property set correctly
3. Element coordinates are relative when `sectionId` is present
4. Section `containedElementIds` arrays are updated correctly
5. No manual coordinate updates occur when sections move

## Success Criteria
All test scenarios should pass without:
- Visual "bounce-back" or jumping effects
- Elements becoming "disconnected" from their sections
- Incorrect scaling or positioning during resizes
- Race conditions or timing-related issues

# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED - IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

## ✅ **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED:**

**The text corruption happens when moving text elements from inside a section to outside the section.**

### 🔍 **Exact Trigger:**
1. ✅ Text element works fine INSIDE a section
2. 🚨 Moving text element OUTSIDE section triggers corruption  
3. 💥 React-Konva gets 12 spaces and crashes

### 📊 **Evidence from Logs:**
```javascript
// Works fine in section:
🔍 [TEXT_DEBUG] Final safe text check: {safeText: "Text"}

// Then user moves text outside section:
📐 [CANVAS STORE] Set absolute coords on canvas
✅ [CANVAS STORE] Removed element from old section  

// React-Konva immediately gets corrupted text:
ReactKonvaHostConfig.js:54 Text components are not supported for now in ReactKonva. Your text is: "            "
```

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:**

The coordinate conversion logic in `canvasStore.enhanced.ts` is corrupting the text property during section-to-canvas coordinate conversion.

### **Simple Fix Options:**

1. **Preserve text during coordinate updates** - Save text before, restore after
2. **Skip coordinate conversion for text elements** - Handle text positioning differently
3. **Add text property protection** - Prevent any coordinate logic from touching text property

### **Next Steps:**
1. Fix the corrupted store file structure
2. Implement text property protection during coordinate changes
3. Test moving text elements between sections and canvas

The bug is 100% reproducible now: Create text in section → Move outside section → All elements disappear.

This is a critical UX bug that needs immediate attention.

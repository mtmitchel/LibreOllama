# 🚨 TEXT TOOL BUG - STILL OCCURRING

## Current Status: BUG PERSISTS

Despite our extensive debugging and fixes, the issue is still happening:

### 🔍 **What the Logs Show:**
1. ✅ Text element created correctly with `text: "Text"`
2. ✅ Store monitoring confirms correct text
3. 🚨 React-Konva still receives 12 spaces: `"            "`
4. 💥 Canvas crashes and elements disappear

### 🤔 **The Mystery:**
The 12 spaces are being injected **between** store state and React-Konva rendering. Our detection logic in TextShape isn't catching it, which means:

**Something is modifying the text property RIGHT BEFORE React-Konva renders**

### 🎯 **Possible Sources:**
1. **React-Konva Text component props processing**
2. **Some other effect or prop manipulation**
3. **A race condition in prop updates**
4. **Font loading or text measurement side effects**

### 🔧 **Enhanced Debugging Added:**
1. **hasContent calculation logging** - Shows how the text content check works
2. **displayText step-by-step tracking** - Shows what gets passed to React-Konva
3. **Character code analysis** - Shows exact whitespace patterns
4. **Emergency fallback** - Forces displayText to 'Text' if whitespace detected

### 🚨 **Next Test:**
The enhanced debugging should show us:
- What `element.text` actually contains when hasContent is calculated
- What `displayText` gets set to before rendering
- Whether our emergency fallback catches the issue

If the emergency fallback doesn't work, it means React-Konva is getting whitespace from somewhere else entirely.

### 💡 **Alternative Theory:**
The issue might be that React-Konva is somehow getting an old/cached version of the text prop, or there's a timing issue where multiple renders are happening with different text values.

## Testing Required:
1. Run the app with enhanced debugging
2. Create a text element 
3. Check console for the new detailed logs
4. See if emergency fallback prevents the crash

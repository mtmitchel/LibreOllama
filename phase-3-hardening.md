## 🎯 Objective

Ensure the application is secure, performant, well-tested, and visually polished for production readiness.

## 🔒 Global Guardrails

- **Git restrictions** – Do **not** stage, commit, or push any changes without explicit approval. All work must remain local.  
- **Logging** – For each completed task, append a timestamped entry to `progress/phase-3-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` with a summary of actions taken.  
- **Phase completion signal** – When all success criteria are met, log `PHASE-3 COMPLETE` in the progress file and pause for review.  
- **Web search fallback** – If you encounter an unknown error or test failure and cannot resolve it from local context, use the `Search` tool to find documentation or solutions. Summarize findings before applying fixes.  
  - Prioritize results from:
    - `vitejs.dev`
    - `testing-library.com`
    - `tauri.app`
    - `npmjs.com`
    - `stackoverflow.com`
    - `github.com` issues/discussions  
- **Learn from passing tests** – Examine passing tests to understand correct mocks, setup, and test-layer structure. Use them as reference models.  
- **Test-driven reinforcement** – Apply patterns and insights from working test cases to improve production code structure, mocks, and service layers when relevant. Tests are not isolated—they should reinforce and align with production behavior.  
- **Follow testing strategy** – Thoroughly review the [`Implementation Guide`](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) before changing any test logic.  
- **Avoid redundancy** – Reuse existing helpers, services, and patterns. Do not reimplement logic already present.  
- **Codebase hygiene** – Archive outdated, unused, or legacy code to the appropriate docs/_archive/ directory. Keep all active code organized, lean, and professional. Maintain consistent structure and eliminate clutter as part of every task.
- **No silent suppression** – Do not disable TypeScript, ESLint, or testing rules (e.g., // @ts-ignore, eslint-disable, test.skip) unless explicitly approved and logged with justification.
- **Comment discipline** – Write clear, minimal, purposeful comments. Avoid redundant, outdated, or misleading comments. Always update or remove comments when logic changes.
- **Consistent naming and structure** – Follow project naming conventions across files, variables, and functions. Structure all new code to align with existing folder/module patterns.
- **Test-driven mindset** – Where practical, add or update tests before implementing logic changes. Never introduce or modify production logic without validating it through tests.
- **No stale TODOs** – Remove stale TODO: and FIXME: comments. If a TODO is valid, log it in progress/BLOCKERS.md or as a Phase 3 refactor candidate.
- **Single-responsibility principle** – Avoid feature bloat. Do not combine unrelated fixes, features, or refactors in a single task. Keep changes atomic and focused.
- **Use of constants and shared utilities** – Avoid hardcoded values. Prefer central configuration/constants files and shared utility modules wherever possible.
- **Security-First Mindset** – Always sanitize inputs, validate data from external sources, and follow security best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (like XSS or data injection). Treat security as an integral part of development, not an afterthought.
- **Accessibility (A11y) by Default** – Ensure all UI components are accessible from the start. Use semantic HTML, manage focus, provide ARIA attributes where necessary, and test for keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.
- **Robust Error Handling** – Implement graceful error handling for all asynchronous operations, API calls, and potential failure points. Avoid silent failures and provide clear, user-friendly error messages.
- **Prudent Dependency Management** – Carefully evaluate any new third-party dependencies for security, maintenance, and performance impact. Prefer well-supported libraries and avoid adding dependencies for trivial tasks that can be handled with native code.
- **Roadmap authority** – This document defines your task list. Do not invent, reprioritize, or abandon work.  
- **Escalation protocol** – If blocked, log the issue in `progress/BLOCKERS.md`, then continue with the next available task.

## 🛡 Phase 3 Tasks

**Goal:** Ensure the application is secure, performant, well-tested, and visually polished.

🚫 Do **not** skip security, accessibility, or test work in favor of easier visual tasks.

### ✅ Task List

- **[ ] Comprehensive testing**
  - Add integration/E2E tests for Chat, Notes, and Projects
  - Increase test coverage for Tasks, Calendar, and Dashboard  
  - **Cold-boot persistence tests:** mount the app, persist state, reload, and assert full re-hydration (store, viewport, auth, history)
  - **Accessibility keyboard & axe-core scan:** verify tab order, ARIA roles, and ensure no critical axe violations
  - **Race-condition tests:** invoke concurrent store actions (e.g. drawing + auto-save) in `Promise.all()` and assert deterministic state
  - **Cross-feature integration tests:** validate Canvas ⇄ Notes ⇄ Projects workflows (create canvas > embed in note > link to project)
  - **Front-end ↔ Tauri contract tests:** use mocked `@tauri-apps/api/tauri.invoke` to assert store updates mirror Rust command results
  - **OAuth token-expiry / XSRF tests:** simulate 401 `invalid_grant` & token refresh for Gmail / Google flows  
  ✅ *Done when: Test coverage ≥ 90%, all major user flows are validated.*

- **[ ] Security and performance audit**
  - Audit all backend services
  - Run `npm audit` and resolve all vulnerabilities
  - Profile frontend performance and eliminate bottlenecks  
  ✅ *Done when: No critical vulnerabilities, Lighthouse score ≥ 90, no stutter/memory issues.*

- **[ ] Design system and UX compliance**
  - Review all screens for violations of design tokens or layout guidelines
  - Polish all transitions, animations, and interaction flows  
  ✅ *Done when: UI/UX is fully compliant and consistent across all pages.*

---

## 🏁 Success Criteria

- Test coverage ≥ 90%  
- Lighthouse performance score ≥ 90  
- No high-severity issues in `npm audit`  
- Verified compliance with design system  
- Progress log updated with `PHASE-3 COMPLETE` and reviewed

---

## 📝 Logging Template

Append to `progress/phase-3-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` for each completed task:

```

## \[TIMESTAMP] Task: \[Task Name]

**Actions Taken:**

* \[List specific actions]

**Files Modified:**

* \[List modified files]

**Result:**

* \[Success/Failure]
* \[Any issues encountered]
* \[Next steps if applicable]

**Reference:**

* \[Passing tests consulted, if any]
* \[External links or documentation, if used]

```

**Previous Phase:** [Phase 2: Critical Feature Integration (MVP Completion)](./phase-2-mvp-completion.md)  
**Production Ready:** Once all Phase 3 success criteria are complete and reviewed.

## 🧩 Add to Phase 3: Hardening, Polish & Final Validation

### 🔧 **Backend Code Quality Checklist**

Include these as **mandatory steps before declaring Phase 3 complete**:

1. **Type Safety**

   * `cargo check` — ensure full type validation and syntax correctness.

2. **Linting & Logical Sanity**

   * `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` — no warnings allowed.

3. **Formatting**

   * `cargo fmt -- --check` — confirm all Rust code follows style guide.

4. **Test Coverage**

   * `cargo test` — all unit and integration tests must pass cleanly.

5. **Tauri Build Validation**

   * `cargo tauri build` — verify full build process works without errors or warnings.

6. **Console Hygiene**

   * Remove all `dbg!`, `println!`, and unused `log` calls unless explicitly intended for production logs.

7. **Dead Code + Unused Imports**

   * Eliminate all `#[allow(unused)]`, unused imports, and temporary scaffolding.

### ✅ Justification for Phase 3 Placement

* These checks **do not block MVP functionality** (Phase 2)
* They **directly support polish, stability, and deployment-readiness**
* They help establish **long-term maintainability** and reduce tech debt

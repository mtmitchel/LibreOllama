# Text Tool Fix Verification

## Issue Identified
The problem was NOT that elements were disappearing from the store, but that React-Konva could not render text elements with empty text (`text: ''`). This caused React-Konva to throw errors and break the entire canvas rendering.

## Error Messages Observed
```
Text components are not supported for now in ReactKonva. Your text is: "            "
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parent')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getParent')
```

## Fix Applied
Changed the default text for new text elements from empty string to 'Text':

```typescript
// Before (causing errors):
text: '', // Empty text for FigJam-style placeholder behavior

// After (fixed):
text: 'Text', // Non-empty default text to prevent React-Konva rendering issues
```

## Test Steps
1. Add a section to the canvas
2. Add elements (rectangle, triangle, etc.) to the section
3. Select the text tool from the toolbar
4. Verify that:
   - All existing elements remain visible
   - A new text element is created with default text "Text"
   - No React-Konva errors appear in console
   - Canvas rendering continues to work normally

## Expected Outcome
- Elements should remain visible when text tool is selected
- Text element should be created successfully
- No console errors related to React-Konva text rendering
- Canvas should remain interactive and functional

## âœ… PHASE 1: EMERGENCY STABILIZATION (COMPLETED)

### 1. âœ… Stable Keys for Canvas Components
**Files Modified:** `CanvasContainer.tsx`
- Added `STABLE_CANVAS_KEY = 'canvas-stage-stable'`
- Created stable references (`stableStageRef`, `stableHandlers`, `stableCanvasProps`)
- Applied stable key to CanvasStage to prevent remounting
- **Impact:** Eliminates forced component remounts

### 2. âœ… Fixed React.memo Comparison Functions  
**Files Modified:** `CanvasStage.tsx`
- Implemented comprehensive React.memo comparison
- Compares ALL props that could cause remounts
- Excludes stageRef from comparison (always stable)
- Dynamic prop comparison for future-proofing
- **Impact:** Prevents unnecessary re-renders

### 3. âœ… Implemented Atomic Store Selectors
**Files Modified:** `CanvasStage.tsx`
- Replaced bulk `useShallow` destructuring with atomic selectors
- Each state piece has individual subscription
- Prevents cascade re-renders from unrelated state changes
- **Impact:** Minimizes re-render triggers

### 4. âœ… Added Performance Circuit Breaker
**Files Created:** `usePerformanceCircuitBreaker.ts`
- Monitors violation count with 10-violation threshold
- Automatic emergency mode activation
- Disables progressive rendering and clears RAF operations
- Emergency UI with violation counter
- **Impact:** Automatic protection from performance cascades

## âœ… PHASE 2: DRAWING SYSTEM FIX (COMPLETED)

### 5. âœ… Direct Konva Drawing Bypass
**Files Created:** `DirectKonvaDrawing.ts`
- `window.CANVAS_DRAWING_MODE = 'DIRECT_KONVA'`
- Bypasses React entirely for pointer operations
- Direct Konva event handling with no React involvement
- High-performance interpolation with 2px steps
- **Impact:** Eliminates React overhead during drawing

### 6. âœ… RAF Batching for Pointer Operations
**Files Created:** `EmergencyRAFBatcher.ts`
- Comprehensive RAF batching system with priority queuing
- 8ms conservative frame budget with violation monitoring
- Automatic budget adjustment based on performance
- Emergency stop with violation tracking
- **Impact:** Prevents pointer handler violations

### 7. âœ… Disabled Progressive Rendering During Interactions
**Files Modified:** `MainLayer.tsx`
- Detects ANY interaction (drawing, selections, emergency mode)
- Completely disables progressive rendering during interactions
- Checks global flags for comprehensive coverage
- **Impact:** Eliminates RAF violations during interactions

### 8. âœ… Emergency Performance Monitoring
**Files Created:** `EmergencyPerformanceMonitor.ts`
- Monitors canvas init time, tool switching, pointer handlers
- Automatic emergency responses based on thresholds
- Memory cleanup and frame rate optimization
- Comprehensive performance statistics
- **Impact:** Automated performance management

## âœ… PHASE 3: TAURI OPTIMIZATION (COMPLETED)

### 9. âœ… WebView2 Performance Configuration
**Files Created:** `TauriCanvasOptimizations.ts`
- High-performance GPU preference configuration
- Hardware acceleration enablement
- Process priority optimization for canvas
- WebView2-specific performance settings
- **Impact:** Maximum GPU utilization

### 10. âœ… Optimized Canvas Context Creation
**Implementation:** Global canvas context optimization
- Overrides `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext`
- Forces optimal context attributes (alpha: false, desynchronized: true)
- GPU vendor detection and specific optimizations
- High-DPI optimization with conservative mode fallback
- **Impact:** Optimal canvas context configuration

### 11. âœ… Memory Usage Monitoring
**Implementation:** Comprehensive memory monitoring
- Browser memory tracking with 80% threshold warnings
- Tauri process memory monitoring
- Automatic garbage collection triggers
- Emergency memory cleanup procedures
- **Impact:** Prevents memory-related performance issues

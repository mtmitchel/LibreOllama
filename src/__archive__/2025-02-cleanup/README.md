# 2025-02 Codebase Cleanup

**Date**: February 5, 2025  
**Type**: Systematic dead code removal across all modules

## Overview

This cleanup session involved a comprehensive analysis of all 10 major modules in the LibreOllama project to identify and archive dead, duplicate, or unused code. The analysis was conducted with senior engineering standards, carefully verifying that code was truly unused before archiving.

## Methodology

1. **Documentation Review**: Read all project documentation, architecture guides, and roadmaps
2. **Historical Context**: Reviewed CHANGELOG and recent commits to understand recent changes
3. **Systematic Analysis**: Analyzed each module individually for dead code
4. **Verification**: Used multiple methods to confirm code was truly unused:
   - Static import analysis
   - Dynamic import checking
   - Feature flag verification
   - Test reference checking
   - Configuration scanning

## Results Summary

- **Modules Analyzed**: 10 (canvas, mail, tasks, calendar, chat, dashboard, projects, agents, notes, settings)
- **Modules with Dead Code**: 3 (canvas, tasks, calendar)
- **Total Files Archived**: 8
- **Empty Directories Removed**: 2
- **Estimated Size Reduction**: ~50KB

## Key Findings

### Clean Modules (7/10)
- **Mail, Chat, Dashboard, Projects, Notes**: Already well-maintained with existing archives
- **Agents**: No feature module yet (only mock implementation)
- **Settings**: Actively used throughout application

### Modules Needing Cleanup (3/10)

#### Canvas Module
- Duplicate utility functions (throttling, feature flags)
- Empty test utils directory

#### Tasks Module  
- Files missed during January 2025 task system unification
- Unused experiment pages not integrated into routing

#### Calendar Module
- Duplicate types.ts file (superseded by types/calendar.ts)
- Unused experiment CSS from previous cleanup
- Empty config directory

## Patterns Observed

1. **Experiment Abandonment**: Experiment files left in production directories
2. **Refactoring Gaps**: Files missed during major refactoring efforts
3. **Duplicate Definitions**: Multiple implementations of similar functionality
4. **Empty Directories**: Incomplete refactoring leaving empty folders

## Recommendations

1. **Dedicated Experiments Folder**: Keep experiments separate from production code
2. **Refactoring Checklist**: Include cleanup verification in PR templates
3. **Quarterly Reviews**: Schedule regular dead code cleanup sessions
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Add automated dead code detection tools

## Impact

- **Code Clarity**: ✅ High - Removed confusion from duplicate files
- **Performance**: ✅ Minimal - Mostly development-time benefits
- **Maintenance**: ✅ High - Cleaner codebase easier to navigate
- **Functionality**: ✅ None - No active features affected

## Restoration

Each subdirectory contains a README with specific restoration instructions. Generally:
1. Copy file from archive to original location
2. Add necessary imports/exports
3. Update any changed APIs
4. Run tests to verify compatibility

**Note**: Some files (like taskMetadataStore.ts) should NOT be restored as they're part of deprecated architectures.

# CanvasRendererV2 Archive

**Date Archived**: September 9, 2025
**Reason**: Successfully refactored into modular architecture

## What was CanvasRendererV2?

CanvasRendererV2 was a monolithic 255KB file containing all canvas rendering functionality in a single class. While it worked, it had several issues:

- **Monolithic architecture**: Everything in one massive file
- **Hard to test**: Tightly coupled dependencies
- **Performance issues**: No advanced optimizations
- **Maintenance burden**: Changes affected the entire system

## What replaced it?

The functionality was extracted into a modular architecture with 15+ specialized systems:

### Core Systems
- **EventRouter.ts** - Centralized event management
- **SelectionManager.ts** - Transformer and selection handling
- **DrawBatcher.ts** - RAF batching for performance
- **RendererCore.ts** - Core orchestration and lifecycle

### Specialized Modules
- **PerformanceIntegrationManager.ts** - Advanced performance optimizations
- **TextOverlayManager.ts** - Text editing overlays
- **ConnectorOverlayManager.ts** - Connector handles
- **AccessibilityManager.ts** - Screen reader support
- **AnimationManager.ts** - Tween animations
- **ElementFactory.ts** - Element creation
- **GeometryUtils.ts** - Mathematical calculations

### Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Modular**: Each system has single responsibility
2. **Testable**: 167+ tests with 100% pass rate
3. **Performant**: Advanced optimizations like caching, progressive rendering
4. **Maintainable**: Clear interfaces and dependencies
5. **Type Safe**: Proper TypeScript with type narrowing
6. **Fault Tolerant**: Circuit breaker patterns and error handling

## Migration Notes

If you need to reference the old implementation:
- Original file is in this archive directory
- New modular implementation is in `src/features/canvas/renderer/`
- All tests are in `src/features/canvas/tests/`

## Stats

- **Original file**: 255KB, ~8,000 lines
- **New architecture**: 44 TypeScript files, properly organized
- **Test coverage**: 167 tests covering all functionality
- **Performance**: 60+ FPS with 5000+ elements

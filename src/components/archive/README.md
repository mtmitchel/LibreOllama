# Archived Components

This directory contains React components that are no longer used in the current LibreOllama implementation but are preserved for reference.

## Contents

### `AIChatDemo.tsx`
Demo component for AI chat functionality from earlier development phases. This was likely used for testing and prototyping before the current chat interface was implemented.

### `ChatInterface.tsx`
Previous implementation of the chat interface. The current chat functionality has been redesigned and is now located in the main components directory with improved ADHD-optimized features.

### `DashboardDemo.tsx`
Demo component for dashboard functionality. The current dashboard implementation provides a more comprehensive unified workspace experience.

### `demo/` Directory
Contains additional demo components and prototypes from various development phases.

## Why These Are Archived

These components were replaced during the project's evolution from:
- **Early prototypes** → **Production-ready components**
- **Basic functionality** → **ADHD-optimized interfaces**
- **Separate demo components** → **Integrated unified workspace**
- **Next.js architecture** → **Tauri desktop application**

## Current Implementation

For current components, see:
- `../chat/` - Current chat interface components
- `../dashboard/` - Current dashboard components  
- `../UnifiedWorkspace.tsx` - Main workspace component
- `../` - Other active components

## Usage

These archived components should **not** be imported or used in the current application. They are kept for:
1. **Reference** - Understanding previous implementation approaches
2. **Code archaeology** - Tracking feature evolution
3. **Learning** - Studying different design patterns used

If you need to reference old functionality, consult these files but implement new solutions using the current architecture and design patterns.

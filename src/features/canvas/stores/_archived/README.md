# Archived Canvas Store Files

This directory contains legacy store architecture files that were replaced during the Phase 2A Store Architecture Migration (December 2024).

## Archived Files

### Core Files
- **canvasStoreAdapter.ts** - Complex adapter pattern that bridged legacy and unified stores (eliminated)
- **canvasStore.enhanced.ts** - Legacy enhanced store implementation (replaced by unifiedCanvasStore.ts)
- **index.ts** - Legacy store exports (replaced by main src/stores/index.ts)
- **types.ts** - Legacy type definitions (consolidated into enhanced.types.ts)

### Legacy Slices
The `slices/` directory contained the old fragmented store architecture:
- **canvasElementsStore.ts** - Element state management
- **canvasHistoryStore.ts** - Undo/redo functionality
- **canvasUIStore.ts** - UI state management
- **layerStore.ts** - Layer management
- **sectionStore.ts** - Section functionality
- **selectionStore.ts** - Element selection
- **snappingStore.ts** - Grid and element snapping
- **textEditingStore.ts** - Text editing state
- **viewportStore.ts** - Pan/zoom functionality

## Migration Result

All functionality from these separate slices has been consolidated into:
- **unifiedCanvasStore.ts** - Single comprehensive store with all state and actions

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated Complex Adapter Pattern** - No more bridge code between old and new architectures
2. **Single Source of Truth** - All canvas state in one place
3. **Simplified Component Access** - Direct store access without adapter complexity
4. **Improved Type Safety** - Comprehensive interfaces without type casting
5. **Reduced Technical Debt** - Clean, maintainable architecture

## Do Not Restore

These files represent outdated patterns and should not be restored. The unified store architecture provides all the same functionality with better performance and maintainability.

# Canvas Store Migration Plan - Phase 2 COMPLETED âœ…

## Overview
Migration from monolithic `konvaCanvasStore.ts` (1866 lines) to modular slices.

## âœ… Completed Successfully
- [x] Modular store slices created and working
- [x] Combined store (`canvasStore.ts`) with shallow comparison
- [x] Type-safe slice composition implemented
- [x] **INFINITE LOOP BUG FIXED** - Added useShallow to all selectors
- [x] Core component migration completed:
  - [x] `CanvasLayerManager.tsx` - Layer management
  - [x] `KonvaCanvas.tsx` - Main canvas component  
  - [x] `CanvasContainer.tsx` - Canvas wrapper
  - [x] `MainLayer.tsx` - Shape rendering
  - [x] `ConnectorTool.tsx` - Connector functionality
  - [x] `ImprovedTable.tsx` - Table component
  - [x] `StickyNoteElement.tsx` - Sticky notes
  - [x] `KonvaApp.tsx` - Application shell
- [x] **TOOLBAR MIGRATION COMPLETED** ðŸŽ¯:
  - [x] `KonvaToolbar.tsx` - Main toolbar functionality
  - [x] Tool selection working with new store
  - [x] Element creation (text, shapes, tables) working
  - [x] Canvas export/import working
  - [x] Undo/redo integration working

## âœ… Hook Migration Completed
- [x] `useViewportControls.ts` - Viewport management
- [x] `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` - Keyboard shortcuts
- [x] `CanvasContainer.tsx` - Main container state

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
- **Runtime Status**: âœ… Development server running without errors
- **Infinite Loop**: âœ… Fixed with `useShallow` in all store selectors  
- **TypeScript**: âœ… Major store migration errors resolved
- **Hot Reloading**: âœ… Working properly
- **Store Architecture**: âœ… Modular slices working as expected
- **Toolbar Functionality**: âœ… Adding elements to canvas working!

## Key Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Shallow Comparison**: Added `useShallow` to prevent infinite re-renders
2. **Modular Hooks**: Split monolithic store into focused slice hooks
3. **Type Safety**: Maintained strong typing throughout migration
4. **Legacy Code Removal**: Cleaned up stage registration and unused functions

## Next Phase: Legacy Store Cleanup
- [x] Remove `konvaCanvasStore.ts` once final validation complete âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Update remaining type imports 
- [ ] Performance optimization (Phase 3)
- Better performance (granular subscriptions)
- Easier testing (isolated slices)
- Cleaner code organization
- Faster development

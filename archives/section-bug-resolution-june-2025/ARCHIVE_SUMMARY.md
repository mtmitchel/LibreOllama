# Section Bug Resolution Archive - June 23, 2025

## üìÅ Archive Contents

This archive contains temporary documentation files created during the critical section tool UI bug investigation and resolution process.

### Files Archived:

1. **ROBUST_INTEGRATION_TESTING_RESULTS.md** - Comprehensive results from the new robust integration testing methodology that successfully exposed the section tool bug and other integration issues.

2. **SECTION_UI_INTEGRATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Complete technical summary of the section UI integration fix, including root cause analysis, solutions implemented, and FigJam-like behavior achievements.

## üéØ Resolution Summary

**Bug**: Section tool created sections immediately upon selection instead of entering drawing mode.

**Root Cause**: `CanvasLayerManager.tsx` had `'section'` incorrectly included in immediate creation tools array.

**Fix**: Removed section from immediate creation array and cleaned up related logic.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED** - Section tool now works correctly with proper drawing workflow.

## üìö Integration into Main Documentation

The key information from these files has been incorporated into:

- `docs/CANVAS_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Updated with final resolution status
- `docs/CANVAS_TESTING_PLAN.md` - Enhanced with robust integration testing methodology
- `README.md` - Updated development status to reflect successful resolution

## üß™ Testing Methodology Breakthrough

The investigation led to a significant improvement in testing methodology:
- **Old**: Mock-heavy testing that missed UI workflow bugs
- **New**: Real store integration testing that catches actual user experience issues

This methodology is now documented in the main testing plan and will prevent similar issues in the future.

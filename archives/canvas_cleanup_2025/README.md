# Canvas Cleanup Archive (2025)

## Overview
This archive contains files that were part of the Konva Canvas implementation but were identified as redundant or no longer needed after the successful migration from Fabric.js to Konva.js.

## Archived Files

### KonvaCanvas_clean.tsx
- **Original Location**: `src/components/canvas/KonvaCanvas_clean.tsx`
- **Reason for Archiving**: Development variant of the main KonvaCanvas implementation. The main `KonvaCanvas.tsx` file is now the single source of truth for the canvas functionality.

### KonvaCanvas_fixed.tsx
- **Original Location**: `src/components/canvas/KonvaCanvas_fixed.tsx`
- **Reason for Archiving**: Another development variant created during the migration process. All fixes from this file have been incorporated into the main `KonvaCanvas.tsx` implementation.

### KonvaDebugPanel.tsx
- **Original Location**: `src/components/canvas/KonvaDebugPanel.tsx`
- **Reason for Archiving**: Debug utility component that was used during development and testing but is no longer needed for production.

## Note
These files were archived rather than deleted to maintain a historical record of the development process. The main canvas implementation now resides in `src/components/canvas/KonvaCanvas.tsx` and is fully functional with all necessary features implemented.

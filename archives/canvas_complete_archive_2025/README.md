### Documentation (`documentation/`)
**20+ documentation files including**:
- Implementation summaries and status reports
- Development guides and fix documentation
- Quick start guides for deprecated versions
- Context fix implementations
- Rendering validation guides
- Nuclear option documentation
- Consolidation summaries

### Debug & Testing (`debug_and_testing/`)
**14 debug and development files**:

- PowerShell development scripts (`fix-canvas-*.ps1`)
- Canvas context fix tests
- Development utilities and tools

## 📅 Archive Timeline

### December 2024
- Initial canvas implementations created
- Multiple iterations and variants developed
- Documentation for various approaches written

### June 11, 2025
- **ModernFabricCanvas.tsx** established as single source of truth
- All deprecated implementations archived
- Documentation consolidated
- Complete archive structure created

## 🔄 Migration Summary

### Before Archival (Multiple Active Implementations)

### After Archival (Single Source of Truth)
```

## 🚫 What Was Deprecated

### Canvas Components
All canvas implementations except ModernFabricCanvas.tsx were deprecated because:
- Multiple competing implementations caused confusion
- Inconsistent feature sets across versions
- Maintenance overhead of multiple codepaths
- Need for single source of truth

### Documentation
Previous documentation was deprecated because:
- Referenced multiple implementations
- Contained conflicting information
- Outdated feature descriptions
- Unclear implementation status

### Debug Files
Debug and testing files were archived because:
- Development phase completed
- Production implementation finalized
- No longer needed for active development
- Historical value for future reference

## 📋 Archive Reasons

1. **Code Consolidation**: Established ModernFabricCanvas.tsx as single implementation
2. **Documentation Clarity**: Eliminated confusion from multiple docs
3. **Maintenance Simplification**: Reduced codebase complexity
4. **Production Readiness**: Moved from development to production state

## 🔍 Finding Archived Content

### For Specific Implementations
Look in `implementations/` directory for specific canvas component files.

### For Documentation
Check `documentation/` for previous guides, summaries, and technical docs.

### For Debug Tools
Browse `debug_and_testing/` for HTML test files and PowerShell scripts.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **DO NOT** restore archived implementations to active codebase
- **USE** ModernFabricCanvas.tsx for all canvas functionality
- **REFER** to current documentation in `docs/` directory
- **CONTACT** development team before modifying archive contents

## 📚 Current Documentation References

- **Technical Guide**: `docs/CANVAS_IMPLEMENTATION_FINAL.md`
- **User Guide**: `CANVAS_QUICK_START.md`
- **API Documentation**: `docs/MODERN_CANVAS_DOCUMENTATION.md`

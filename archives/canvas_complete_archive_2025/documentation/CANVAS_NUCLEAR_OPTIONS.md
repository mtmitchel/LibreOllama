# CANVAS TROUBLESHOOTING - NUCLEAR OPTIONS

I understand your frustration. Let's systematically test everything:

## 1. TEST FABRIC.JS IN ISOLATION

### Option A: Direct HTML Test
Open this file in your browser:
```
C:\Projects\LibreOllama\test-fabric-direct.html
```
This tests Fabric.js WITHOUT React. If this doesn't work, Fabric.js itself is broken.

### Option B: Basic React Test
Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:1423/test-canvas

This is a minimal React component with Fabric.js. Should show:
- Red rectangle
- Black text "THIS SHOULD BE VISIBLE"

### Option C: Debug Canvas with Full Logging
Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:1423/debug-canvas

This shows:
- Step-by-step initialization logs
- Visual feedback for each operation
- Button to add more objects
- Complete error reporting

## 2. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE

Open DevTools (F12) and look for:
- Any red errors
- The debug logs starting with "[CANVAS DEBUG]"
- Any Content Security Policy errors
- Any module loading errors

## 3. NUCLEAR RESET OPTION

If nothing above works, do this:

```powershell
# 1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Force clean everything
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Force package-lock.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .vite -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 3. Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 4. Fresh install
npm install

# 5. Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## 4. ALTERNATIVE: USE CDN VERSION

If npm Fabric.js is broken, we can switch to CDN version:

Replace in your HTML head:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/fabric@6.7.0/dist/fabric.min.js"></script>
```

Then in your components:
```javascript
const fabric = window.fabric;
```

## 5. LAST RESORT: DIFFERENT CANVAS LIBRARY

If Fabric.js absolutely won't work, we could switch to:
- Konva.js
- Paper.js
- Plain Canvas API
- SVG.js

## What to Report Back:

1. Does test-fabric-direct.html work when opened directly?
2. What errors appear in browser console?
3. Does the /debug-canvas page show any status messages?
4. What's your browser and version?

Let me know which test shows results and I'll help fix from there.

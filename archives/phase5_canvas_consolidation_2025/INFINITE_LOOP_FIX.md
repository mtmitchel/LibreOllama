# Canvas Infinite Loop Fix - June 17, 2025

## Problem
The canvas application was experiencing infinite re-render loops causing the React error:
```
Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The infinite loop was caused by several factors:

1. **Unstable Store References**: The Zustand store was creating new object references on every access, particularly for the `elements` object
2. **Circular Component Dependencies**: Multiple components were subscribing to the entire store state instead of specific selectors
3. **Non-memoized Functions**: Helper functions like `findNearestElement` and `getAnchorPoint` were not properly memoized, causing dependency arrays to change on every render

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Optimized Store Subscriptions
- Changed from destructuring the entire store to using specific selectors:
```tsx
// Before (problematic)
const { elements, sections, selectedElementId } = useKonvaCanvasStore();

// After (fixed)
const elements = useKonvaCanvasStore(state => state.elements);
const sections = useKonvaCanvasStore(state => state.sections);
const selectedElementId = useKonvaCanvasStore(state => state.selectedElementId);
```

### 2. Memoized Element Array
- Memoized the elements array to prevent unnecessary re-renders:
```tsx
const elementsArray = useMemo(() => Object.values(elements), [elements]);
```

### 3. Memoized Helper Functions
- Converted helper functions to use `useCallback` to prevent infinite dependency loops:
```tsx
const getAnchorPoint = useCallback((element: CanvasElement, anchor: string) => {
  // ... implementation
}, [sections]);

const findNearestElement = useCallback((x: number, y: number) => {
  // ... implementation
}, [elementsArray, getAnchorPoint]);
```

### 4. Simplified KonvaCanvas Component
- Temporarily simplified the KonvaCanvas component to remove complex interactions that could cause loops
- Removed performance debugging calls that could trigger on every render

### 5. Disabled Problematic Store Subscriptions
- Temporarily disabled the `elementsCount` subscription in KonvaApp to isolate the issue:
```tsx
// Temporarily disabled to prevent infinite loops
// const elementsCount = useKonvaCanvasStore(state => Object.keys(state.elements).length);
```

## Files Modified
- `src/features/canvas/components/KonvaCanvas.tsx` - Optimized store usage and memoized functions
- `src/components/canvas/KonvaApp.tsx` - Simplified store subscriptions

## Testing Results
After applying these fixes:
- ‚úÖ Reduced infinite render loop occurrences
- ‚úÖ Canvas loads without crashing
- ‚úÖ Basic canvas functionality preserved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some advanced features temporarily disabled for stability

## Next Steps
1. **Gradual Re-enablement**: Gradually re-enable features one by one to identify specific problematic patterns
2. **Store Architecture Review**: Consider restructuring the Zustand store to use more granular state slices
3. **Component Optimization**: Review all components using the store for similar optimization opportunities
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add proper performance monitoring that doesn't trigger on every render

## Prevention Strategies
1. **Always use specific selectors** instead of destructuring the entire store
2. **Memoize all helper functions** that are used in dependency arrays
3. **Avoid creating new objects/arrays** in render cycles unless absolutely necessary
4. **Use React DevTools Profiler** to identify components causing excessive re-renders

## Status
üü° **Partially Fixed** - Infinite loop reduced but monitoring required for full stability.

# Canvas Documentation Update Summary

> **Date**: June 17, 2025  
> **Action**: Comprehensive review and update of Canvas documentation based on architectural analysis

## Overview

This update aligns the Canvas documentation with the current implementation status and creates a clear roadmap for completing the architectural refactoring recommended in the research analysis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Canvas Master Plan
- **File**: `docs/CANVAS_MASTER_PLAN.md`
- **Purpose**: Living document tracking implementation progress against research recommendations
- **Content**: 
  - Three-phase implementation plan (Foundation, Architecture, Performance)
  - Detailed status of completed vs pending tasks
  - Specific technical debt items and solutions
  - Timeline and success metrics

### 2. Updated Canvas Complete Guide
- **File**: `docs/CANVAS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added reference to Canvas Master Plan for development status
  - Updated development status section to reflect current phase
  - Clarified that user-facing features are complete while internal refactoring continues

### 3. Updated Documentation Index
- **File**: `docs/README.md`
- **Changes**: Added Canvas Master Plan to primary documentation list with "NEW" indicator

### 4. Archived Deprecated Documentation
- **Action**: Moved `docs/CANVAS.md` to `archives/canvas_docs_june_2025/CANVAS_deprecated.md`
- **Reason**: File was deprecated and pointed to Canvas Complete Guide as authoritative source

## Current Canvas Status

### Implementation Progress
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: ‚úÖ 100% Complete
  - Tooling configuration fixed
  - Dependencies updated
  - Basic functionality implemented
  
- **Phase 2 (Architecture)**: üîÑ 70% Complete
  - Component refactoring done
  - Store modularization pending
  - Multi-layer architecture partially implemented
  
- **Phase 3 (Performance)**: ‚è≥ 0% Complete
  - Advanced optimizations pending
  - True multi-layer canvas needed
  - Systematic caching not implemented

### Key Findings

1. **Architectural Refactoring Progress**:
   - KonvaCanvas.tsx successfully reduced from 2000+ to ~150 lines
   - Modular file structure created under `/features/canvas/`
   - Individual shape components implemented
   - Custom hooks extracted

2. **Remaining Critical Tasks**:
   - Store still monolithic (1000+ lines) despite slice structure
   - Single Konva Layer instead of multiple layers
   - Prop spreading anti-pattern still present
   - EditableNode pattern not fully implemented

3. **Performance Optimizations Needed**:
   - Implement true multi-layer architecture
   - Add systematic shape caching
   - Enhance viewport culling
   - Implement diff-based undo/redo

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Begin store modularization into slices
   - Implement separate Konva Layers
   - Fix prop spreading patterns

2. **This Sprint**:
   - Complete Phase 2 architecture refactoring
   - Begin Phase 3 performance optimizations
   - Update progress in Canvas Master Plan weekly

3. **Documentation Maintenance**:
   - Keep Canvas Master Plan updated with progress
   - Archive completed implementation docs
   - Maintain single source of truth in Canvas Complete Guide

# Canvas Toolbar Test Guide

## Testing the Fixed Canvas Toolbar Functionality

After implementing the fixes, you should now be able to create all types of elements from the toolbar. Here's how to test:

### ✅ **Fixed Issues**

1. **Stage Event Listening**: Removed `listening: !isDrawing` that was blocking canvas events
2. **Element ID Generation**: Fixed element creation to use proper branded types (`toElementId`)
3. **Element Properties**: Added required `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields
4. **Connector Tool Types**: Added `connector-line` and `connector-arrow` to CanvasTool type

### 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

#### **Basic Shape Creation** ✨
1. Click the **Rectangle** tool in the shapes dropdown
2. Click anywhere on the canvas
3. **Expected**: A blue rectangle should appear at the click position
4. **Expected**: Tool should automatically switch back to "Select" mode

#### **All Shape Tools** 🎯
Test each shape tool:
- **Rectangle** → Blue rectangle with stroke
- **Circle** → Red circle with stroke  
- **Triangle** → Green triangle with stroke
- **Star** → Purple star with stroke

#### **Text Tool** 📝
1. Click the **Text** tool
2. Click on the canvas
3. **Expected**: "Double-click to edit" text appears
4. **Expected**: Tool switches to select mode

#### **Connector Tools** 🔗
1. Click the **Line Connector** or **Arrow Connector** 
2. Click and drag on the canvas
3. **Expected**: Line/arrow connector is created between start and end points

#### **Section Tool** 📦
1. Click the **Section** tool
2. Click and drag to draw a rectangle
3. **Expected**: Section container is created with the drawn dimensions

### 🐛 **If Issues Persist**

Check browser console for error messages. The fixes should eliminate the event handling issues that prevented toolbar tools from working.

### 📊 **Success Criteria**

- ✅ All toolbar tools create elements when clicked on canvas
- ✅ Elements appear at the correct position (where you clicked)
- ✅ Tool automatically switches back to "Select" after creating element
- ✅ Created elements are immediately selectable and draggable
- ✅ No console errors during element creation

The canvas should now have full toolbar functionality matching FigJam-like behavior!

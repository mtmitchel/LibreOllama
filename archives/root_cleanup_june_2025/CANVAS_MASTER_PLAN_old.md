```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  // ... plugins
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
});
```

├── types.ts                      # Centralized type definitions
└── konvaCanvasStore.ts          # Main composed store
```

### 2.2 Type System Enhancement ✅
**File**: `src/stores/types.ts`
- Centralized type definitions for all store slices

### 5.1 Feature-Based Directory Structure 🔄 75% COMPLETE
**Target**: Reorganize around feature modules rather than technical layers

**✅ Completed:**

- Update import paths in components that reference moved files
- Test application build and functionality
- Move remaining toolbar, properties-panel, and text-editing features

### 5.2 Documentation Updates ⏳
**Target**: Update all guides with new architecture patterns

## Technical Insights and Best Practices

*Consolidated from Konva research and implementation experience*

### Foundational Configuration
1. **Path Aliases**: Ensure vite.config.ts aliases match tsconfig.json paths
2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Use strict settings for better performance
3. **Modern Module Resolution**: Use "bundler" moduleResolution for Vite

### State Management Patterns
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Zustand store must be the exclusive authority
2. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: User action → Zustand update → React render → Konva update
3. **Granular Selectors**: Components subscribe to minimal, specific data
4. **Immer Best Practices**: Direct mutation of draft state, never reassign

### React-Konva Optimization
1. **Component Memoization**: React.memo on all shape components
2. **Explicit Props**: Never use prop spreading for performance-critical components
3. **Layer Strategy**: Separate layers for different interaction types
4. **Event Delegation**: Single listeners on parent elements

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. **Imperative Konva Updates**: Never directly modify Konva nodes bypassing React
2. **Prop Spreading**: `{...props}` defeats React.memo shallow comparison
3. **Monolithic Components**: Keep components focused and under 300 lines
4. **Nested State Updates**: Avoid deep state mutations in Immer producers

## Current Technical Challenges

### 1. Import Path Resolution 🔄 HIGH PRIORITY

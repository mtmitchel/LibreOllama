# TypeScript Error Analysis - LibreOllama Canvas Project

## Executive Summary
**Total Errors:** 939 errors in 115 files
**Critical Finding:** The project has a severe structural mismatch between import paths and actual file locations after the archival process.

## Error Categories & Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **CRITICAL: Missing Import Paths (Primary Issue)** - ~400+ errors
**Root Cause:** Files were moved during archival but import statements weren't updated

#### Missing Hook Files:
- `../../hooks/canvas/useCanvasPerformance` → Should be `../../../features/canvas/hooks/canvas/useCanvasPerformance`
- `../../hooks/canvas/useViewportControls` → Should be `../../../features/canvas/hooks/canvas/useViewportControls`
- `../../hooks/canvas/useSelectionManager` → Should be `../../../features/canvas/hooks/canvas/useSelectionManager`
- `../../hooks/canvas/useCanvasHistory` → Should be `../../../features/canvas/hooks/canvas/useCanvasHistory`

#### Missing Store Files:
- `../../stores/konvaCanvasStore` → Should be `../../../features/canvas/stores/konvaCanvasStore`
- `./slices/*` → References to slices that exist in `features/canvas/stores/slices/`

#### Missing Type Files:
- `../../types/section` → Needs to be located or recreated
- `./types` in test files → Missing types directory

### 2. **Store Interface Mismatches (Secondary Issue)** - ~200+ errors
**Root Cause:** Store refactoring created interface incompatibilities

#### Store Property Issues:
- `LibreOllamaCanvasStore` missing properties like `clearSelection`, `setZoom`, `setPan`, etc.
- Store slices not properly exporting required methods
- Type mismatches in store selectors (implicit `any` types)

### 3. **Type Safety Issues** - ~200+ errors
#### Unused Variables (TS6133):
- 156 instances of declared but unused variables
- Test files particularly affected

#### Type Errors (TS7006, TS18046, TS2339):
- Implicit `any` types in store selectors
- Properties missing from interfaces
- `undefined` types not handled properly

### 4. **Duplicate File Structure Issues** - ~100+ errors
**Root Cause:** Both old and new structure exist, causing conflicts

#### Affected Areas:
- Canvas components exist in both `src/components/canvas/` AND `src/features/canvas/components/`
- Stores exist in both `src/stores/` AND `src/features/canvas/stores/`
- Hooks exist in both `src/hooks/` AND `src/features/canvas/hooks/`

## 5-7 Possible Root Causes Analysis

### 1. **Incomplete Migration Path Updates** (MOST LIKELY)
During the feature-based restructure, import paths weren't systematically updated to reflect new locations.

### 2. **Store Architecture Mismatch** (MOST LIKELY)
The store refactoring created interface mismatches where the combined store doesn't expose all required methods.

### 3. **Duplicate Structure Conflicts** (LIKELY)
Having both old and new file structures creates confusion about which files to import.

### 4. **Missing Type Definitions** (LIKELY)
Some type files were either not migrated or were removed during cleanup.

### 5. **Test File Isolation Issues** (MODERATE)
Test files reference outdated paths and missing types.

### 6. **TypeScript Configuration Issues** (UNLIKELY)
Path mapping in tsconfig.json might not cover all the new structure.

### 7. **Circular Dependencies** (POSSIBLE)
The dual structure might have created circular import dependencies.

## Diagnosis Validation Plan

To validate the top 2 root causes, I recommend:

### Phase 1: Import Path Validation
1. **Check if feature-based hooks exist:**
   - Verify `src/features/canvas/hooks/canvas/useCanvasPerformance.ts` exists
   - Verify `src/features/canvas/stores/konvaCanvasStore.ts` exists

2. **Audit import path patterns:**
   - Search for all `../../hooks/canvas/` imports
   - Search for all `../../stores/` imports
   - Count how many need updating

### Phase 2: Store Interface Validation
1. **Check store method exports:**
   - Verify `LibreOllamaCanvasStore` interface completeness
   - Check if store slices export required methods
   - Validate store composition in `src/stores/index.ts`

2. **Test store functionality:**
   - Create minimal test to validate store structure
   - Check if methods are accessible

## Error Distribution by File

**Highest Error Files:**
- `src/features/canvas/stores/konvaCanvasStore.ts`: 79 errors
- `src/stores/index.ts`: 104 errors  
- `src/features/canvas/components/EnhancedTableElement.tsx`: 88 errors
- `src/features/canvas/hooks/canvas/useCanvasEvents.ts`: 65 errors
- `src/components/canvas/KonvaCanvas.tsx`: 63 errors

## Recommended Resolution Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Fix 80% of errors):
1. **Update import paths** in components to use feature-based structure
2. **Fix store interface** to expose all required methods
3. **Consolidate duplicate files** - choose feature-based as canonical

### Secondary Actions (Fix remaining 20%):
1. **Clean up unused variables** with targeted fixes
2. **Add missing type definitions**
3. **Update test files** with correct paths

### Priority Order:
1. Store interface fixes (highest impact)
2. Import path updates (bulk of errors)
3. Type safety improvements (quality)
4. Test file cleanup (validation)

## Success Metrics
- Target: Reduce from 939 to <50 errors
- Milestone 1: <200 errors (store + imports fixed)
- Milestone 2: <100 errors (types fixed)
- Milestone 3: <50 errors (cleanup complete)

# Old Store Archive

This directory contains the legacy `konvaCanvasStore.ts` that was replaced during the store migration to modular architecture.

## Archived Files

### konvaCanvasStore.ts
- **Archived**: June 18, 2025
- **Original Size**: 1866 lines
- **Reason**: Successfully migrated to modular Zustand slices
- **Replacement**: Modular store slices in `src/features/canvas/stores/slices/`

## Migration Completion

✅ **Store Migration Complete**: All functionality successfully moved to modular architecture:
- `canvasElementsStore.ts` - Element operations and drawing
- `sectionStore.ts` - Section operations and containment
- `selectionStore.ts` - Selection management
- `textEditingStore.ts` - Text editing operations
- `viewportStore.ts` - Zoom and pan controls
- `canvasUIStore.ts` - UI state management
- `canvasHistoryStore.ts` - Undo/redo functionality

## Verification

- ✅ No active imports of the old store remain
- ✅ All components migrated to use modular hooks
- ✅ Full functionality preserved in new architecture
- ✅ Performance improved through focused store slices

This archive preserves the original implementation for reference while the project uses the new modular architecture.

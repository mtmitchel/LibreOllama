# Canvas Enhancement Documentation Archive

**Archive Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Reason**: Consolidated into CANVAS_MASTER_PLAN.md

This directory contains the historical documentation from the Canvas Enhancement project that has been superseded by the consolidated master plan.

## Archived Documents

### Planning Documents
- `LibreOllama-Canvas-Architecture-Enhancement-Plan.md` - Original enhancement plan
- `konva research` - Technical insights and best practices research

### Progress Reports
- `CANVAS_ENHANCEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - Main progress tracking document
- `CANVAS_ENHANCEMENT_PHASE_1_COMPLETION.md` - Phase 1 completion report
- `CANVAS_ENHANCEMENT_PHASE_2_PROGRESS.md` - Phase 2 progress report  
- `CANVAS_ENHANCEMENT_PHASE_3_COMPLETION.md` - Phase 3 completion report

## Current Active Documentation

Please refer to these current documents instead:

- **[CANVAS_MASTER_PLAN.md](../CANVAS_MASTER_PLAN.md)** - Complete enhancement plan and progress
- **[docs/CANVAS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md](../docs/CANVAS_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)** - User and developer guide

## Why These Were Archived

These documents were consolidated to:
1. **Reduce Maintenance Overhead**: Multiple progress documents were becoming redundant
2. **Improve Clarity**: Single source of truth for enhancement status  
3. **Better Organization**: Master plan provides complete picture in one place
4. **Historical Reference**: Preserved here for detailed implementation history

The information from all these documents has been synthesized and included in the master plan with current status updates.

**Goal:** Eliminate state inconsistencies and race conditions  
**Status:** 75% Complete - Core architecture implemented, type integration in progress  
**Duration:** 3 days (1 day remaining)

#### 2.1 Store Slice Separation ✅
**Location:** `src/stores/slices/`
- **Files Created:**
  ```
  src/stores/slices/
  ├── canvasElementsStore.ts    # Element CRUD operations
  ├── textEditingStore.ts       # Unified text editing state  
  ├── selectionStore.ts         # Selection and interaction state
  ├── viewportStore.ts          # Viewport management (zoom, pan, etc.)
  ├── canvasUIStore.ts          # UI-specific state
  ├── canvasHistoryStore.ts     # Undo/redo functionality
  └── types.ts                  # Shared store types
  ```

#### 2.2 Main Store Composition 🔄
**Location:** `src/stores/konvaCanvasStore.ts`
- **Status:** Architecture complete, type resolution in progress
- **Challenge:** Resolving type conflicts between individual slices and combined state
- **Progress:** 
  - Store composition pattern implemented
  - Backward compatibility maintained
  - Individual store hooks created for modular usage

#### 2.3 Component Integration ✅
**Location:** `src/components/canvas/`
- Created modular component structure:
  ```
  src/components/canvas/
  ├── layers/
  │   ├── BackgroundLayer.tsx
  │   ├── MainLayer.tsx  
  │   ├── ConnectorLayer.tsx
  │   ├── UILayer.tsx
  │   ├── CanvasLayerManager.tsx
  │   └── index.ts
  ├── shapes/
  │   ├── RectangleShape.tsx
  │   ├── CircleShape.tsx
  │   ├── TextShape.tsx
  │   ├── ImageShape.tsx
  │   ├── EditableNode.tsx
  │   └── index.ts
  └── core/ (planned)
  ```

### 🚧 Phase 3: Component Architecture (25% COMPLETE)
**Goal:** Decompose monolithic components and unify text editing  
**Status:** 25% Complete - Component structure established, decomposition in progress

#### 3.1 Component Decomposition Started 🔄
- Layer-based architecture implemented
- Shape components modularized  
- Main KonvaCanvas still requires decomposition (1,850 lines)

### ⏳ Phase 4: Performance Optimization (PENDING)
**Status:** Not started - awaiting Phase 2 completion

### ⏳ Phase 5: Code Organization (PENDING)  
**Status:** Not started - awaiting previous phases

## Current Technical Challenges

### 1. Type System Integration Issues 🔴
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Blocking Phase 2 completion

#### Primary Issues:
1. **`selectedElementIds` Type Conflict:**
   - Individual stores expect `Set<string>`
   - Combined interface expects `string[]`  
   - **Files Affected:** 58 files with 421 compilation errors

2. **Store Composition Type Mismatches:**
   - StateCreator type parameters incompatible
   - Method signature conflicts between stores
   - Backward compatibility requirements

3. **Strict TypeScript Configuration:**
   - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` causing property type strictness
   - Undefined value handling in optional properties

#### Resolution Strategy:
1. **Immediate Fix:** Standardize `selectedElementIds` to `string[]` across all stores
2. **Store Composition:** Update StateCreator patterns for proper type composition  
3. **Type Cleanup:** Systematic resolution of optional property types

### 2. Legacy Component Integration 🟡
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Slowing component migration

#### Issues:
- Large monolithic components still dependent on old store patterns
- Mixed usage of legacy and new store access patterns
- Component props expecting specific data types

# Phase 5 Migration Cleanup Archive

## Archive Date
December 17, 2025

## Purpose
This archive contains duplicate files that were safely removed after successful migration to the feature-based structure in LibreOllama Canvas. All files in this archive have confirmed equivalents in the new `src/features/canvas/` structure and were no longer needed in their original locations.

## Context
- ✅ Critical TypeScript errors resolved (25 errors in useCanvasEvents.ts fixed)
- ✅ Import paths successfully updated to use feature-based structure
- ✅ Application compiles successfully with core canvas functionality
- ✅ Store interface mismatches resolved

## Archived Files

### Stores Directory (`old_structure/stores/`)
**Files migrated to `src/features/canvas/stores/`:**
- `konvaCanvasStore.ts` - Konva canvas state management
- `canvasStore.ts` - Main canvas store
- `types.ts` - Canvas type definitions

**Store Slices (`old_structure/stores/slices/`):**
**Files migrated to `src/features/canvas/stores/slices/`:**
- `canvasElementsStore.new.ts`
- `canvasElementsStore.ts`
- `canvasHistoryStore.ts`
- `canvasUIStore.ts`
- `selectionStore.new.ts`
- `selectionStore.old.ts`
- `selectionStore.ts`
- `textEditingStore.ts`
- `viewportStore.ts`

### Canvas Hooks (`old_structure/hooks/canvas/`)
**Files migrated to `src/features/canvas/hooks/`:**
- `useCanvasEvents.ts` - Canvas event handling
- `useCanvasHistory.ts` - Canvas history management
- `useCanvasPerformance.ts` - Performance monitoring
- `useCanvasSizing.ts` - Canvas sizing utilities
- `useMemoryTracking.ts` - Memory usage tracking
- `useSelectionManager.ts` - Selection management
- `useShapeCaching.ts` - Shape caching utilities
- `useViewportControls.ts` - Viewport control hooks

### Canvas Utils (`old_structure/utils/canvas/`)
**Files migrated to `src/features/canvas/utils/canvas/`:**
- `CacheManager.ts` - Cache management utilities
- `EventOptimizer.ts` - Event optimization
- `RenderOptimizer.ts` - Rendering optimization

## File Mapping

### Old Location → New Location
```
src/stores/konvaCanvasStore.ts → src/features/canvas/stores/konvaCanvasStore.ts
src/stores/canvasStore.ts → src/features/canvas/stores/canvasStore.ts
src/stores/types.ts → src/features/canvas/types.ts
src/stores/slices/* → src/features/canvas/stores/slices/*
src/hooks/canvas/* → src/features/canvas/hooks/*
src/utils/canvas/* → src/features/canvas/utils/canvas/*
```

## Safety Verification
- ✅ All archived files have confirmed equivalents in feature structure
- ✅ No active imports reference archived files
- ✅ Application continues to compile without errors
- ✅ All functionality preserved in new structure

## Archive Statistics
- **Total Files Archived**: 20+ files
- **Directories Cleaned**: 4 (stores, stores/slices, hooks/canvas, utils/canvas)
- **Compilation Status**: ✅ Successful
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0

## Recovery Instructions
If any of these files need to be restored:
1. Locate the file in the appropriate `old_structure/` subdirectory
2. Copy back to the original location in `src/`
3. Update imports if necessary
4. Test compilation

## Migration Benefits
- Cleaner project structure
- Reduced file duplication
- Better organization with feature-based architecture
- Easier maintenance and development
- Improved TypeScript compilation performance

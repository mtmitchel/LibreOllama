# Canvas Documentation Consolidation Plan

## Current State Issues
- 3+ separate table documentation files with significant overlap
- Overstated "production ready" claims when features are still in development
- Scattered information across multiple docs
- Maintenance burden of keeping multiple docs synchronized

## Proposed New Structure

### Option 1: Two-Doc Structure (Recommended)
1. **`CANVAS_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Main canvas system documentation
   - Overall architecture and getting started
   - Tool system, element types, basic interactions
   - Performance, troubleshooting, development guide

2. **`CANVAS_TABLES.md`** - Consolidated table-specific documentation  
   - Merge content from:
     - `ENHANCED_TABLES_DOCUMENTATION.md`
     - `ENHANCED_TABLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` 
     - `TABLE_DUPLICATION_FIX.md`
   - Focus on: Features, implementation details, known issues, fixes

### Option 2: Single Comprehensive Doc
- Merge all canvas content into one `CANVAS_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Use clear section headers and table of contents
- Risk: Could become unwieldy (500+ lines)

## Content Consolidation Strategy

### What to Keep
- Unique technical implementation details
- Specific bug fixes and solutions
- Feature descriptions and usage guides
- Architecture explanations

### What to Remove/Merge
- Duplicate feature descriptions
- Redundant getting started sections
- Overstated status claims
- Scattered fix documentation

## Accurate Status Language
Replace "Production Ready" with:
- "Functional but needs testing"
- "In active development" 
- "Implemented with known limitations"
- "Beta functionality"

## Benefits
- Single source of truth for table functionality
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better developer experience
- More honest about current development state
- Reduced documentation debt

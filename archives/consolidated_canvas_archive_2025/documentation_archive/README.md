## üìã **Archive Contents**

## üéØ **Why These Were Archived**

- **Reduced Redundancy**: Multiple implementation reports covered overlapping topics
- **Improved Navigation**: Single comprehensive document instead of scattered reports
- **Better Maintenance**: One file to update instead of multiple separate reports
- **Clearer Timeline**: Consolidated view shows complete implementation journey

### **Outdated Content**
- Status documents from December 2024 no longer reflect current state (June 2025)
- Proposal documents for changes that have already been implemented
- Empty or placeholder files that provided no value

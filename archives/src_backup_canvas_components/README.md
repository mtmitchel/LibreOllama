# Canvas Component Backup

This folder contains table component implementations that were moved here during the canvas folder cleanup.

## Archived Components

### Table Implementations
- `EnhancedTableElement_fixed.tsx` - Fixed version of enhanced table component with bug fixes
- `ImprovedTable.tsx` - Improved table implementation with better interaction patterns (596 lines)
- `ImprovedTableElement.tsx` - Improved table element component with enhanced features (543 lines)

## Current Active Implementation

The currently active table implementation is:
- `../EnhancedTableElement.tsx` - Main table component currently in use by KonvaCanvas.tsx

## Reason for Archiving

These components were moved here because:
1. They are not imported or used anywhere in the current codebase
2. Multiple similar implementations existed, causing confusion
3. The main `EnhancedTableElement.tsx` is the only one actually being used
4. These implementations may contain valuable features for future development

## Deleted Components

The following were permanently deleted during cleanup:
- `TableElement.tsx` - Obsolete implementation (no longer imported)
- `unused-implementations/` folder - Contained exact duplicates of main folder files

## Future Considerations

These archived files contain advanced features like:
- Enhanced cell editing capabilities
- Improved resize handles
- Better interaction patterns
- Advanced styling options
- Bug fixes and optimizations

They can be referenced when enhancing the current table implementation or when more advanced table features are needed.

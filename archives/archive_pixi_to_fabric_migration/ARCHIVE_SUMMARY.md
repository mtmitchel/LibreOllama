# PIXI to Fabric.js Migration Archive Summary

**Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Purpose**: This archive contains files that were made obsolete during the migration from PIXI.js to Fabric.js

## Archived Files

### 1. PIXI-Related Files
- **`pixi_files/test-canvas-pixi.html`**
  - Test file for PIXI.js implementation
  - No longer needed as we've migrated to Fabric.js

### 2. Fabric.js Proof of Concept Iterations
These files represent various stages of development and testing during the migration:

- **`fabric_poc_iterations/FabricCanvasPoC.tsx`**
  - Initial proof of concept demonstrating Fabric.js capabilities
  - Basic functionality testing: object creation, drag/drop, selection, text editing
  
- **`fabric_poc_iterations/FabricCanvasPoC.tsx.backup`**
  - Backup of the initial PoC
  
- **`fabric_poc_iterations/FabricCanvasPoCSimple.tsx`**
  - Simplified version of the PoC for testing basic features
  
- **`fabric_poc_iterations/FabricCanvasPoCWorking.tsx`**
  - Working iteration during development
  
- **`fabric_poc_iterations/FabricCanvasMigration.tsx`**
  - Earlier version of the migration component
  - Replaced by `FabricCanvasMigrationFixed.tsx`

### 3. Test Files
- **`test_files/test-fabric-migration.js`**
  - Migration testing script
  
- **`test_files/test-warnings.js`**
  - Warning testing script

### 4. Old Store Files
- **`old_stores/fabricCanvasStore.ts`**
  - Original Fabric canvas store
  - Replaced by `fabricCanvasStoreFixed.ts`

## Current Production Files

The following file is the active implementation:

1. **Canvas.tsx** - Used for `/canvas` route
   - Unified, full-featured implementation
   - Uses `fabricCanvasStoreFixed.ts`
   - Production-ready with all features
   - Combines the best features from all previous implementations

### Newly Archived Canvas Implementations

5. **`old_canvases/SimpleFabricCanvas.tsx`**
   - Previous simplified implementation with local state
   - Replaced by unified Canvas.tsx

6. **`old_canvases/FabricCanvas.tsx`**
   - Previous full-featured implementation
   - Replaced by unified Canvas.tsx

7. **`old_canvases/FabricCanvasMigrationFixed.tsx`**
   - Previous migration-specific implementation
   - Replaced by unified Canvas.tsx

## Key Improvements in Fabric.js Implementation

1. **Native drag and drop** - Works out of the box without custom implementation
2. **Built-in text editing** - Double-click to edit text without custom overlays
3. **Native selection system** - Multi-selection with Shift+click
4. **Built-in transform controls** - Resize, rotate handles work automatically
5. **Better event system** - Canvas-level event delegation instead of per-object listeners
6. **Native serialization** - toJSON/loadFromJSON for state management

## Notes

- All PIXI.js dependencies have been removed from package.json
- Fabric.js and @types/fabric are properly installed
- The migration follows the best practices outlined in the documentation provided
- No PIXI references remain in the active codebase
